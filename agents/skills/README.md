# AI Agent Skills & Prompts

This directory maintains the exact system instructions, context boundaries, and responsibilities for the AI agents that power the platform.

As we progress through the **Implementation Plan**, we will perform research and then create specific `.md` files here (e.g., `pipeline_director.md`, `continuity_analyst.md`). 

## Skill Document Structure
Each skill document must contain:
1. **Agent Role**: What is this agent's job?
2. **Required Context**: What Generic Containers and relationships does it need to see?
3. **Execution Pipeline**: The exact step-by-step reasoning it must follow.
4. **Validation Rules**: Constraints (e.g., "Do not reveal secrets marked hidden").
