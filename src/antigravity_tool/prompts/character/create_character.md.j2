# Task: Create Character - {{ new_character_name }}

Role: **{{ new_character_role }}**

You are creating a character for a manga/manhwa project called **{{ project_name }}**.

{% if world_summary and world_summary.name %}
## World Context

- **World**: {{ world_summary.name }} ({{ world_summary.genre }})
- **Tone**: {{ world_summary.tone }}
- **Time Period**: {{ world_summary.time_period }}
- **Description**: {{ world_summary.description }}
{% endif %}

{% if existing_characters %}
## Existing Characters

The following characters already exist. Consider relationships and dynamics:
{% for char in existing_characters %}
- **{{ char.name }}** ({{ char.role }}): {{ char.one_line }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if narrative_style and narrative_style.tone %}
## Narrative Style
- **Tone**: {{ narrative_style.tone }}
- **Dialogue Style**: {{ narrative_style.dialogue_style }}
{% endif %}

## Instructions

Create a complete character profile for **{{ new_character_name }}** as a **{{ new_character_role }}**. This character will be visually rendered in manga/manhwa panels, so physical descriptions must be extremely specific and consistent.

Focus on:
1. **Distinct visual identity** - they must be instantly recognizable in any panel
2. **Unique voice** - their dialogue should sound different from every other character
3. **Clear motivation** - what drives them in every scene
4. **Visual character DNA** - precise, repeatable physical description for image generation
