- **Time Period**: {{ existing_world.time_period }}

## Instructions

Create a comprehensive world-building document. Ask the user about their preferences, then fill in the following structure. Be specific and vivid - this world will be visually rendered as manga/manhwa panels.

For each element, think about how it would LOOK in a panel. Describe colors, architecture, atmosphere, lighting.
