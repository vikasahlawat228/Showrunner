# Task: Create Story Outline ({{ structure_type }})

You are outlining a manga/manhwa story using the **{{ structure_type }}** framework.

## Project: {{ project_name }}

{% if world_summary and world_summary.name %}
## World
- **{{ world_summary.name }}** ({{ world_summary.genre }})
- {{ world_summary.description }}
{% endif %}

{% if characters %}
## Characters
{% for char in characters %}
- **{{ char.name }}** ({{ char.role }}): {{ char.one_line }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if narrative_style and narrative_style.tone %}
## Narrative Style
- **Tone**: {{ narrative_style.tone }}
- **Themes**: {{ narrative_style.themes | join(', ') if narrative_style.themes else 'Not set' }}
{% endif %}

{% if existing_structure and existing_structure.logline %}
## Existing Structure
- **Logline**: {{ existing_structure.logline }}
- **Premise**: {{ existing_structure.premise }}
{% endif %}

## Instructions

Create a complete beat-by-beat story outline. Each beat should be specific enough to guide scene writing later. Think about:
1. Visual moments that would make powerful manga/manhwa panels
2. Cliffhanger potential at chapter boundaries
3. Character transformation beats aligned with story beats
4. Pacing: action sequences interspersed with quiet character moments
