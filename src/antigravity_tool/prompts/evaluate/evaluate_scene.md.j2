- Is there subtext (gap between what's said and meant)?
- Are dialogue lines concise enough for speech bubbles?
- Do action beats accompany dialogue naturally?
- Are speech patterns consistent with character definitions?

{% elif criterion == "consistency" %}
Evaluate for internal consistency:
- Do characters behave in line with their established personalities?
- Are world rules followed or broken (intentionally/accidentally)?
- Is continuity maintained with previous scenes?
- Are relationship dynamics consistent?

{% elif criterion == "emotional_arc" %}
Evaluate the emotional journey:
- Does the scene follow its stated emotional arc?
- Are emotional transitions earned, not jarring?
- Is the emotional impact appropriate for the story beat?
- Does the ending create forward momentum?
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
