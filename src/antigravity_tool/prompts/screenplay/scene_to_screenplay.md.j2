## Instructions

Convert this scene into a screenplay format with numbered beats. Each beat should be a single moment that could become one or more panels. Think cinematically:

- **DIALOGUE** beats: Character speaks (include parentheticals for tone)
- **ACTION** beats: Physical action happens (describe what would be DRAWN)
- **INTERNAL** beats: Character's thoughts (narration boxes in manga)
- **NARRATION** beats: Narrator voice-over
- **SFX** beats: Important sound effects
- **TRANSITION** beats: Scene transitions, time skips

Keep dialogue manga-sharp: short, impactful, no wasted words.
