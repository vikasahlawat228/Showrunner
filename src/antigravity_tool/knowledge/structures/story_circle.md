# Dan Harmon's Story Circle

## Overview

Dan Harmon's Story Circle is an eight-step character-driven narrative structure derived from Joseph Campbell's monomyth and distilled into its most essential, repeatable form. Harmon developed the framework while creating *Community* and *Rick and Morty*, and it has become one of the most widely used structures in episodic storytelling, serialized fiction, and character-driven narratives.

The Story Circle's central insight is that all satisfying stories follow the same deep pattern: a character is in a zone of comfort, they want something, they enter an unfamiliar situation to get it, they adapt, they get what they wanted, they pay a heavy price for it, they return to their familiar situation, and they have changed. The power of the framework lies in its emphasis on the difference between what a character WANTS and what they NEED -- and the price of transformation.

The eight steps are arranged in a circle, not a line. The top half represents the character's known world (order, comfort, consciousness). The bottom half represents the unknown world (chaos, challenge, the unconscious). Crossing from top to bottom is the descent into the unfamiliar. Crossing from bottom to top is the return, transformed. This circular structure means the character ends where they began -- but different.

## The 8 Steps

### Step 1: YOU (A character is in a zone of comfort)

**What it means:** Establish who the character is in their default state. Not their backstory, not their potential -- who they are right now, in the moment before the story disrupts them. What is their zone of comfort? What routines do they follow? What beliefs do they hold? What are they afraid of? What are they avoiding?

**The Want vs. Need framework:** The character's comfort zone is built on top of an unmet NEED. The character does not know (or refuses to acknowledge) this need. Their comfort zone is actually a cage built from avoidance. The character may appear functional, but they are incomplete.

**What to establish:**
- The character's default behavior and relationships
- The character's conscious WANT (what they think would make their life better)
- The character's unconscious NEED (what would actually make them whole)
- The gap between the Want and the Need -- this gap IS the story
- The flaw or coping mechanism that keeps the character stuck

**Character-centric application:** Do not describe the character. Show the character in action. A character who NEEDS to trust others might be shown eating alone by choice, declining an invitation, locking their door three times. A character who NEEDS to accept failure might be shown obsessively practicing, unable to stop, snapping at anyone who interrupts. The comfort zone should feel understandable -- even relatable -- while also feeling like a trap.

---

### Step 2: NEED (But they want something)

**What it means:** A desire emerges or is articulated. The character becomes aware of something they want -- a goal, an object, a person, a status, an achievement, an answer. This want is typically conscious, specific, and tangible. It may or may not align with what the character actually needs.

**The Want vs. Need framework:** The Want is the surface-level motivation that drives the plot. The Need is the deep-level transformation that gives the story meaning. In most powerful stories, the Want and the Need are misaligned:

- A character WANTS to win the tournament (external goal). They NEED to learn that strength is not about defeating others but protecting what matters (internal transformation).
- A character WANTS to be left alone (external goal). They NEED to let someone in (internal transformation).
- A character WANTS revenge (external goal). They NEED to let go of the past (internal transformation).
- A character WANTS to be loved by a specific person (external goal). They NEED to love themselves first (internal transformation).

The story will spend most of its time pursuing the Want. The Need will only be addressed when the Want fails -- at the bottom of the circle.

**What to establish:**
- A clear, specific, articulable Want
- The triggering event that makes the Want urgent
- Enough information for the audience to sense the Need, even if the character cannot

**Character-centric application:** Have the character state or demonstrate their Want clearly. "I want to be the strongest." "I want her to notice me." "I want to get out of this town." The clearer the Want, the more powerful its eventual insufficiency will feel. Meanwhile, plant the Need in the subtext: a character who wants to be the strongest flinches when someone mentions teamwork.

---

### Step 3: GO (They enter an unfamiliar situation)

**What it means:** The character takes action and crosses into new territory. They leave their comfort zone -- physically, socially, emotionally, or psychologically -- to pursue their Want. The unfamiliar situation presents rules, dynamics, and challenges the character is not equipped to handle with their current self.

**The Want vs. Need framework:** The character enters the unfamiliar situation driven by their Want. They bring their flaw and their coping mechanisms with them. At first, these tools might even seem to work. But the unfamiliar situation is specifically designed (by the author) to be an environment where the character's flaw will eventually be exposed and their coping mechanisms will fail.

**What should happen:**
- A clear boundary crossing -- the character leaves behind something familiar
- The new environment should feel genuinely different (new people, new rules, new challenges)
- The character's initial approach should be rooted in their flaw (they try to handle the new situation with old tools)
- Early interactions should hint at why the old approach will not be sufficient

**Character-centric application:** The crossing must be an active choice. The character is not kidnapped into the story; they walk in. Even if external events force the situation, the character's choice to engage rather than flee is the meaningful action. Show the cost of entry: what does the character leave behind, risk, or give up by stepping into the unknown?

---

### Step 4: SEARCH (They adapt to it)

**What it means:** The character navigates the unfamiliar situation. They learn the rules, make allies, face challenges, and develop new skills. They pursue their Want with increasing competence. This is the longest step and the one that delivers the "promise of the premise."

**The Want vs. Need framework:** The character is getting better at pursuing their Want, but they are not addressing their Need. In fact, each success in pursuing the Want may be reinforcing the flaw. A character who needs to trust others might be succeeding through solo brilliance, confirming their belief that they do not need anyone. A character who needs to let go of control might be winning through increasingly rigid planning, confirming their belief that control is the answer. The Search feels like progress, but it is hollow progress -- the Want is being pursued, but the Need is being ignored.

**What should happen:**
- Escalating challenges that test the character
- Relationship development (allies, rivals, mentors)
- Skill building and world exploration
- Moments of apparent success that are actually the flaw in disguise
- The audience should feel the character getting closer to their Want while sensing the unaddressed Need growing like a shadow

**Character-centric application:** This is where most of your character development happens through interaction. Every new relationship should function as a mirror, reflecting a different aspect of the character's flaw or need. An ally might embody what the character needs but refuses to see. A rival might embody the flaw taken to its extreme. A mentor might have walked the same path and either succeeded or failed at the same transformation.

---

### Step 5: FIND (They get what they wanted)

**What it means:** The character achieves their Want -- or appears to. They reach the goal, win the prize, get the relationship, achieve the status, or find the answer they were seeking. This is the midpoint of the story and the bottom of the circle.

**The Want vs. Need framework:** This is the critical moment where the Want and the Need collide. The character gets what they Wanted, but it does not feel the way they expected. Something is wrong. The achievement is hollow, or it comes with a cost they did not anticipate, or it reveals that the Want was never the real goal. Getting the Want without addressing the Need is like eating without tasting -- the hunger is not satisfied.

This is the moment of truth: the character must begin to realize (consciously or unconsciously) that what they wanted is not what they needed. The bottom of the circle is the deepest point in the unknown -- the farthest from the comfort zone -- and it is here that the real transformation begins.

**What should happen:**
- The character achieves or appears to achieve their Want
- The achievement feels incomplete, wrong, or costly
- A revelation or consequence forces the character to see their flaw
- The B Story relationship often delivers this truth
- The character begins (perhaps reluctantly) to confront their Need

**Character-centric application:** Make the achievement genuinely desirable. Do not undercut the Want. The character SHOULD have wanted this thing -- it just should not have been the ONLY thing. A character who wanted to be the strongest gets their victory, and it is glorious -- but they are standing alone in the arena, and the person they wanted to impress has already left. The Want is real. The Need is realer.

---

### Step 6: TAKE (They pay a heavy price for it)

**What it means:** Achieving the Want has consequences. The price is paid in the currency of the character's flaw -- the very thing they have been avoiding catches up to them. Relationships fracture. Trust is broken. The coping mechanism that held their world together collapses. The character suffers not despite their success but because of it.

**The Want vs. Need framework:** The price is directly connected to the character's refusal to address their Need. The character who needed to trust others and instead succeeded through solo brilliance now finds that their allies feel used and abandoned. The character who needed to let go of control has controlled their way into a situation where everything depends on their plan, and the plan has just failed catastrophically. The price should feel inevitable in retrospect -- the audience should be able to trace the line from the flaw in Step 1 to the catastrophe in Step 6.

**What should happen:**
- Loss -- real, painful, and connected to the flaw
- Consequences of the choices made during the Search (Step 4)
- The collapse of the coping mechanism
- Isolation or confrontation with the truth of the Need
- The lowest emotional point of the story

**Character-centric application:** The price must be personal. World-ending stakes can enhance the price, but the core payment must be something the character values deeply. It is not enough for the world to be at risk -- the character's most important relationship, their self-image, or their foundational belief must be shattered. The character at this stage should be stripped of everything that made the comfort zone comfortable and everything they gained in the Search.

---

### Step 7: RETURN (They return to their familiar situation)

**What it means:** The character begins the journey back to the known world. They must cross the threshold again, but they are not the same person who left. The Return is not simply going home -- it is the act of bringing the transformation (painfully won) back into the context where it matters.

**The Want vs. Need framework:** The character now understands (or is beginning to understand) the difference between their Want and their Need. The Return is the act of choosing the Need over the Want. This may mean:

- Giving up the prize to repair a relationship
- Going back to help someone they abandoned
- Facing the person they wronged
- Accepting the truth they have been avoiding
- Acting from the Need rather than the Want for the first time

The Return often involves a final challenge -- the last test of whether the character has truly changed. They must make a choice that their old self (the Step 1 self) would have made differently.

**What should happen:**
- The character chooses to return, act, or face what they have been avoiding
- A final test that requires the character to act from their Need rather than their Want
- The synthesis of everything learned in the unfamiliar situation
- The climactic moment where internal change produces external action

**Character-centric application:** The Return must feel earned. The character is not returning because the plot requires it -- they are returning because they have changed enough to choose differently. This is where the story's theme is made tangible through action. The character does not say "I've learned to trust others" -- they demonstrate it by relying on an ally in the final moment, by letting go of control, by being vulnerable when it matters most.

---

### Step 8: CHANGE (Having changed)

**What it means:** The character is back in their familiar situation, but they are different. The comfort zone of Step 1 is recognizable, but the character's relationship to it has fundamentally shifted. They have addressed their Need. They have paid the price. They are not "better" in a simple sense -- they are more complete, more honest, more capable of engaging with life as it actually is rather than as they wished it to be.

**The Want vs. Need framework:** The character has released the Want (or redefined it) and embraced the Need. The external situation may or may not have improved, but the character's internal state has transformed. The change should be visible in their behavior, their relationships, and their choices. The audience should be able to imagine the character's future and see that it will be meaningfully different from the past they witnessed in Step 1.

**What should show:**
- The character in the same or similar context as Step 1, but behaving differently
- Relationships that have evolved or healed
- A visual or behavioral callback to Step 1 that highlights the transformation
- A sense of earned peace, acceptance, or readiness -- not perfection, but growth
- The Need, addressed, has opened a space that the Want could never fill

**Character-centric application:** The most powerful Change is specific, not general. Do not show the character generically happier. Show them doing the specific thing they could not do in Step 1. The character who ate alone now accepts an invitation. The character who locked the door three times now leaves it unlocked. The character who could not stop practicing puts down their instrument and sits in silence, at peace. The change should be small enough to be believable and large enough to be meaningful.

**Top half (Steps 1, 2, 7, 8):** The known world. Order, comfort, consciousness. The character is in (or returning to) familiar territory.

**Bottom half (Steps 3, 4, 5, 6):** The unknown world. Chaos, challenge, the unconscious. The character is navigating unfamiliar territory.

**Left side (Steps 8, 7, 6, 5):** The descent and its cost. Moving from comfort to crisis.

**Right side (Steps 1, 2, 3, 4):** The ascent and its reward. Moving from comfort through adaptation.

**The threshold crossing (between 2-3 and between 6-7):** The two moments where the character crosses between worlds. The first crossing is driven by Want. The second crossing is driven by Need.

## Want vs. Need: The Framework in Depth

The Want vs. Need distinction is the single most important concept in the Story Circle. Every step of the circle gains meaning from the tension between these two forces.

### How to Identify the Want

The Want is:
- Conscious -- the character can articulate it
- External -- it involves achieving, obtaining, or changing something in the world
- Specific -- it is a clear, concrete goal
- Sympathetic -- the audience should understand why the character wants this

### How to Identify the Need

The Need is:
- Unconscious (at first) -- the character does not know they need this, or they actively resist it
- Internal -- it involves changing who the character is, not what they have
- Thematic -- it is connected to the story's central argument about how to live
- Uncomfortable -- addressing the Need requires the character to face their flaw

### The Relationship Between Want and Need

The most effective stories create a specific relationship between Want and Need:

1. **The Want is a misguided attempt to address the Need.** A character who needs connection seeks power (believing power will make them worthy of love). A character who needs to accept imperfection pursues perfection (believing perfection will bring peace).

2. **Pursuing the Want delays addressing the Need.** Every step toward the Want is a step away from the Need -- until the bottom of the circle, where the Want fails and the Need becomes undeniable.

3. **The Need is the price of the Want.** To get what they truly need, the character must give up (or radically redefine) what they want. This is the sacrifice at the heart of the story.

4. **The Changed character integrates Want and Need.** The best endings do not simply replace the Want with the Need. They show the character finding a way to honor both -- usually by redefining the Want in light of the Need. The character who wanted power and needed connection finds a way to be powerful THROUGH connection.

## Applying the Story Circle

### For Individual Episodes / Chapters

The Story Circle is designed to be repeatable. Every episode of a series, every chapter of a manga, every arc of a long-running story can follow the eight steps. The key is scaling:

**Single chapter (20-30 pages):**
- Steps 1-2: Pages 1-5 (establish situation, reveal want)
- Steps 3-4: Pages 5-15 (enter unfamiliar situation, navigate it)
- Steps 5-6: Pages 15-22 (get what they wanted, pay the price)
- Steps 7-8: Pages 22-30 (return, show change)

**Single arc (5-15 chapters):**
- Steps 1-2: Chapters 1-2
- Steps 3-4: Chapters 3-8
- Steps 5-6: Chapters 8-12
- Steps 7-8: Chapters 12-15

**Full series:**
- Steps 1-2: Opening arc
- Steps 3-4: Development arcs (the bulk of the series)
- Steps 5-6: Crisis arc
- Steps 7-8: Final arc

### For Ensemble Casts

Each character in an ensemble can be on their own Story Circle, at a different step. While the protagonist is at Step 4 (Search), a supporting character might be at Step 6 (Take). This creates dramatic irony and narrative richness. The protagonist is on the way up while their ally is on the way down. Their circles intersect, creating moments where one character's transformation catalyzes another's.

**Practical technique:** Map each major character's circle on paper. Identify where the circles overlap and where they diverge. The most dramatically powerful scenes are the ones where two characters are at opposite points on their respective circles.

### For Character-Driven Visual Storytelling

The Story Circle's character focus makes it ideal for manga and manhwa because visual media can show internal change through external details:

- **Step 1 (You):** Design the character's default posture, expression, and spatial relationship to others. These are the baseline that will change.
- **Step 3 (Go):** Change the environment. New backgrounds, new visual language. The character should look slightly out of place.
- **Step 5 (Find):** The character's posture and expression at their apparent victory should contain a seed of wrongness -- a smile that does not reach the eyes, a trophy held at arm's length.
- **Step 6 (Take):** Visual isolation. The character alone in the frame, smaller than their environment, stripped of the visual markers of success.
- **Step 8 (Change):** Mirror Step 1 with visible differences. Same setting, different body language. Same relationship, different proximity. Same expression, different eyes.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. The Want and the Need are the same thing.

If the character wants love and needs love, there is no tension between the two forces and no reason for the story to exist. The Want and the Need must be in tension. The character wants the wrong version of the right thing, or the right version of the wrong thing. The gap between them is the story.

### 2. The character changes without paying a price.

Transformation without cost is wish fulfillment, not story. The character must lose something real in Step 6. If they get the Want AND the Need without sacrifice, the ending feels unearned. The price is what makes the Change meaningful.

### 3. The circle is only applied to the macro-structure.

The Story Circle works best when it operates at multiple scales simultaneously. Each scene, each chapter, each arc, and the full series should each have their own circle. A character who has not changed within a single chapter has not given the reader a reason to turn the page.

### 4. The unfamiliar situation (Step 3) is not unfamiliar enough.

The bottom of the circle must feel genuinely different from the top. If the character's "unfamiliar situation" is just a slightly different version of their comfort zone, the transformation will not be believable. Push them into territory where their old tools genuinely fail.

### 5. The Return (Step 7) is skipped.

Many stories jump from the price (Step 6) directly to the change (Step 8) without showing the character actively choosing to return and face their familiar world as a new person. The Return is where the character's agency is most visible -- they choose to go back, to face the people and places they left, to demonstrate their change. Without it, the change feels like something that happened TO the character rather than something they chose.

### 6. The Change is too dramatic or too subtle.

A character who was selfish becoming perfectly selfless is not believable. A character who was afraid becoming slightly less afraid is not satisfying. The Change should be specific, visible, and proportional to the price paid. The character is not fixed -- they are different. They have traded one way of being for another, and the trade should feel real.

## The Story Circle vs. Other Frameworks

| Aspect | Story Circle | Hero's Journey | Save the Cat |
|--------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Focus** | Character psychology | Mythic transformation | Plot mechanics |
| **Steps** | 8 | 12 | 15 |
| **Scalability** | Highly scalable (scene to series) | Best at series/arc level | Best at series/film level |
| **Core engine** | Want vs. Need tension | Ordinary World vs. Special World | Beat-driven pacing |
| **Best for** | Character-driven stories, ensemble casts, episodic structure | Epic journeys, coming-of-age, single-hero narratives | Tightly plotted stories, genre fiction |
| **Weakness** | Can feel formulaic if overused | Complex for short-form | Overly prescriptive for literary fiction |

The Story Circle's greatest strength is its simplicity and repeatability. Eight steps. Want vs. Need. Descent and return. Change. It is a framework that a writer can internalize completely and apply instinctively, which makes it especially powerful for serialized storytelling where structure must be maintained across hundreds of chapters without becoming mechanical.
