# Save the Cat Beat Sheet

## Overview

The Save the Cat Beat Sheet is a 15-beat story structure developed by screenwriter Blake Snyder. It provides precise percentage markers for where each narrative beat should land, making it one of the most prescriptive and reliable frameworks for pacing a story. While originally designed for film, the beat sheet translates powerfully to manga, manhwa, webtoons, and serialized visual storytelling when adapted to chapter and episode structures.

The name comes from Snyder's principle that a protagonist must do something early in the story -- like saving a cat -- to earn audience sympathy before the plot intensifies.

## The 15 Beats

### Beat 1: Opening Image (0-1%)

**What it is:** A single snapshot that establishes the tone, mood, and starting state of the protagonist's world. It is the "before" photograph of your story.

**What should happen:** Show the protagonist in their ordinary world, but frame it so the audience can feel what is wrong, missing, or incomplete. The opening image should create a visual or emotional contrast with the Final Image (Beat 15).

**Manga/Manhwa application:** This is your first panel spread or opening page. In webtoons, it is the first scroll-stopping image. Use it to establish the art style contract with the reader. A solo-leveling style story might open on the protagonist failing publicly. A romance might open on an empty seat beside the protagonist on a train.

**Common mistakes:**
- Starting with worldbuilding exposition instead of character state
- Making the opening generic (a cityscape, a sunrise) rather than specific to the protagonist's emotional condition
- Failing to create a deliberate contrast with the ending

---

### Beat 2: Theme Stated (5%)

**What it is:** A line of dialogue or visual moment where the story's thematic question is posed, usually by a secondary character. The protagonist does not yet understand it.

**What should happen:** Someone says something -- offhand, in passing, or directly -- that captures the central argument of the story. "You can't keep running forever." "Power without connection is just loneliness." The protagonist either ignores it, dismisses it, or does not grasp its weight.

**Manga/Manhwa application:** Place this in conversation. A mentor's aside. A friend's joke that is actually serious. In visual storytelling, you can reinforce the theme with a background detail: a cracked mirror, a wilting flower, a poster on the wall. The reader does not need to notice it consciously on first read -- it should resonate on rereading.

**Common mistakes:**
- Making the theme too on-the-nose or preachy
- Having the protagonist agree with the theme immediately (they should resist it)
- Skipping this entirely and leaving the story thematically adrift

---

### Beat 3: Set-Up (1-10%)

**What it is:** The extended establishment of the protagonist's world, relationships, flaws, and the things that need fixing. This is where you "plant" everything that will "pay off" later.

**What should happen:** Introduce the main cast. Show the protagonist's flaw in action -- not by telling us about it, but by letting us watch it create problems. Establish the rules of the world. Plant every important object, relationship, and ability that will matter in Act 2 and Act 3. If a sword will be critical in the climax, it should appear here, even in the background.

**Manga/Manhwa application:** Use this section to establish your visual language. If you are writing a battle manga, show the power system in a small, low-stakes way. If you are writing a romance, establish the social dynamics of the school, workplace, or community. Introduce supporting characters with distinct silhouettes and speech patterns so readers can track them across chapters.

**Common mistakes:**
- Introducing too many characters at once without distinct visual/verbal identities
- Spending too long on setup and delaying the Catalyst
- Failing to plant the seeds that Act 2 and Act 3 will harvest

---

### Beat 4: Catalyst (10%)

**What it is:** The inciting incident. Something happens that makes the old world unsustainable. Life as the protagonist knew it is over.

**What should happen:** This is not a choice -- it is something that happens TO the protagonist. A letter arrives. A monster attacks. A person walks into their life. A secret is revealed. The key requirement is that after this moment, the protagonist cannot simply return to the status quo of Beat 3.

**Manga/Manhwa application:** This is your chapter-ending cliffhanger in a serialized format, or the dramatic page-turn moment. In a 200-page volume, this lands around page 20. In a webtoon with 60-80 panels per episode, this is the end of Episode 1. Visually, give this moment space -- a full-page panel, a dramatic angle, a shift in the color palette.

**Common mistakes:**
- Making the catalyst too small (the protagonist could just ignore it)
- Making it an internal decision rather than an external event
- Burying it in dialogue instead of giving it visual and narrative weight

---

### Beat 5: Debate (10-20%)

**What it is:** The protagonist's reaction to the Catalyst. They hesitate, question, resist, or prepare. This is the last moment of reluctance before commitment.

**What should happen:** The protagonist wrestles with the call to action. They may seek advice, weigh the risks, try to find an alternative, or simply freeze. This beat answers the question: "Should I do this?" The audience should feel the genuine weight of what the protagonist is about to give up.

**Manga/Manhwa application:** This is excellent territory for internal monologue panels, flashbacks to what the protagonist stands to lose, and conversations with allies or mentors. In battle manga, this might be the protagonist training or researching the threat. In romance, this is the protagonist debating whether to confess, move to a new city, or take the risk.

**Common mistakes:**
- Skipping the debate entirely (protagonist jumps in without hesitation, which feels hollow)
- Making the debate too long and killing momentum
- Having the debate be purely internal without external stakes or pressure

---

### Beat 6: Break into Two (20%)

**What it is:** The protagonist makes a decisive choice and crosses into the "upside-down world" of Act 2. This must be an active decision, not something forced upon them.

**What should happen:** The protagonist chooses to act. They enter the tournament. They accept the quest. They confess their feelings. They walk through the door. This is the moment the protagonist stops being passive and becomes the driver of the story. The world on the other side should feel distinctly different from the setup.

**Manga/Manhwa application:** This is a major structural transition. In serialized manga, this often aligns with the end of the first arc or the first major chapter break. Visually mark the transition: a new setting, a costume change, a shift in panel composition. Many manga use a literal journey -- the protagonist leaves their hometown, enters a new school, or crosses into another world.

**Common mistakes:**
- Making it a passive event rather than an active choice
- Failing to make Act 2 feel genuinely different from Act 1
- Not giving the moment enough narrative weight

---

### Beat 7: B Story (22%)

**What it is:** A new character or relationship enters the story, carrying the thematic argument. The B Story is almost always a relationship -- a love interest, a mentor, a rival, a new friend.

**What should happen:** Introduce or deepen a relationship that will serve as the vehicle for the story's theme. While the A Story (the external plot) tests the protagonist's abilities, the B Story tests their beliefs. The B Story character often represents the lesson the protagonist needs to learn.

**Manga/Manhwa application:** In shonen manga, this is often the rival or mentor figure who embodies an alternative worldview. In romance manga, the B Story might be a friendship subplot that mirrors or contrasts the main romance. In webtoons, the B Story provides emotional variety between action or tension beats. Give the B Story character a distinct visual identity and their own arc.

**Common mistakes:**
- Making the B Story completely disconnected from the theme
- Introducing the B Story character too late
- Treating the B Story as filler rather than the thematic spine of the narrative

---

### Beat 8: Fun and Games (20-50%)

**What it is:** The "promise of the premise." This is the section where the story delivers on the concept that attracted the audience in the first place. It is the longest single beat.

**What should happen:** If your story is about a chef in a cooking battle, this is where we see spectacular cooking. If it is about a mage learning magic, this is where we see creative spell use. The protagonist explores their new world, tests their abilities, and experiences the upside of their decision. The stakes are present but not yet crushing. There is a feeling of momentum, discovery, and rising confidence.

**Manga/Manhwa application:** This is the engine of serialized manga. Tournament arcs, training montages, slice-of-life episodic chapters, exploration sequences, date chapters in romance -- this is where your genre delivers its core appeal. Pacing should be dynamic: alternate between high-energy sequences and quieter character moments. This is where you build the reader's investment in the cast.

**Common mistakes:**
- Rushing through the fun to get to the "serious" parts
- Making this section feel like filler with no forward progress
- Forgetting to escalate -- even in the fun section, each sequence should raise the stakes slightly
- Neglecting character development in favor of spectacle

---

### Beat 9: Midpoint (50%)

**What it is:** A major turning point at the exact center of the story. It is either a "false victory" (things seem great but the foundation is hollow) or a "false defeat" (things seem terrible but the seeds of recovery have been planted). The stakes rise from wants to needs, from personal to public.

**What should happen:** Something shifts fundamentally. New information is revealed. The protagonist achieves a goal but realizes it is not what they actually needed. Or the protagonist suffers a loss that reframes the entire conflict. The midpoint connects the A Story and the B Story and raises the stakes to a new level. After the midpoint, the clock starts ticking.

**Manga/Manhwa application:** This is your mid-arc twist or the moment between major arcs. In a tournament arc, this might be the moment the protagonist wins their bracket but discovers the tournament itself is rigged. In romance, this is the false relationship, the misunderstanding that seems to bring them together but actually highlights the real gap between them. Give this moment a full chapter ending or dramatic page spread.

**Common mistakes:**
- Having no midpoint at all (the story sags in the middle)
- Making the midpoint too subtle -- it should be unmistakable
- Failing to raise the stakes (the second half should feel harder than the first)

---

### Beat 10: Bad Guys Close In (50-75%)

**What it is:** External pressures mount and internal flaws intensify. The antagonist (or antagonistic forces) respond to the protagonist's progress, and the protagonist's team begins to fracture.

**What should happen:** The villain or opposition regroups, adapts, and strikes back. Allies begin to doubt. Internal conflicts surface. The protagonist's flaw -- the one planted in the setup -- starts causing real damage. Plans unravel. Trust erodes. The walls close in from both outside and inside.

**Manga/Manhwa application:** This is the escalation arc. In battle manga, this is where the villain reveals their true power or the protagonist's allies start falling. In romance, this is the misunderstanding arc, the interference of a rival, the pressure from family or society. Visually, increase the tension: tighter panel compositions, darker tones, more close-ups on strained expressions. Let scenes end on unresolved tension.

**Common mistakes:**
- Only applying external pressure without internal deterioration
- Making the "bad guys" literal when they could be internal doubts, social pressure, or consequences of the protagonist's own choices
- Not connecting the closing-in to the protagonist's established flaw

---

### Beat 11: All Is Lost (75%)

**What it is:** The lowest point. The protagonist loses everything they gained in the Fun and Games section, and often more. Snyder calls this the "whiff of death" -- something or someone dies, literally or metaphorically.

**What should happen:** The mentor dies. The relationship ends. The power is lost. The team disbands. The protagonist's flaw has created a catastrophe they cannot undo. This is not just a setback -- it is a moment that forces the protagonist to confront the fundamental lie they have been telling themselves.

**Manga/Manhwa application:** This is one of your most powerful chapters. Give it room to breathe. In manga, the All Is Lost beat often gets a full chapter with minimal dialogue and maximal visual storytelling. Wide, empty panels. The protagonist alone. Rain. Silence. In webtoons, slow the scroll pacing -- fewer panels per screen, more negative space. Let the reader sit in the loss.

**Common mistakes:**
- Making the loss feel reversible or trivial
- Skipping the emotional weight to rush to the recovery
- Having the "death" feel random rather than a consequence of the protagonist's flaw

---

### Beat 12: Dark Night of the Soul (75-80%)

**What it is:** The emotional aftermath of the All Is Lost. The protagonist sits in their grief, defeat, or shame. They are at rock bottom with no clear path forward.

**What should happen:** The protagonist reflects, mourns, and is forced to be honest with themselves -- often for the first time. They confront their flaw. They remember the Theme Stated (Beat 2) and finally understand it. This is a moment of internal stillness before the turn. No external action resolves it; the protagonist must resolve it within themselves.

**Manga/Manhwa application:** This pairs with the All Is Lost chapter. It might be a quiet chapter focused entirely on the protagonist sitting alone, remembering, or being found by the B Story character. Flashback panels to earlier moments (the theme stated, the setup) can recontextualize everything. This is where manga's strength in visual metaphor shines: symbolic imagery, dream sequences, memory montages.

**Common mistakes:**
- Rushing through this to get to the climax
- Having an external character solve the protagonist's internal crisis
- Making the dark night generic sadness rather than specific confrontation with the flaw

---

### Beat 13: Break into Three (80%)

**What it is:** The protagonist synthesizes what they have learned from both the A Story and the B Story and formulates a new plan. They are transformed -- not fully, but enough to try again with a fundamentally different approach.

**What should happen:** The protagonist has an insight, often triggered by the B Story relationship, that fuses the lesson of the theme with a practical plan of action. They are not just trying again; they are trying differently. The old approach (driven by the flaw) is abandoned. The new approach (informed by the theme) is adopted.

**Manga/Manhwa application:** This is the "resolve" chapter. The protagonist stands up. They declare their new intention. In battle manga, this is the training revelation, the new technique born from understanding rather than power. In romance, this is the moment the protagonist decides to be honest, to stop running. Give the protagonist a visual transformation moment: a new expression, a shift in posture, a symbolic visual change.

**Common mistakes:**
- Having the plan be the same as before but with "trying harder"
- Skipping the synthesis -- the protagonist needs BOTH the A Story and B Story insights
- Making the break feel like it came from nowhere instead of from genuine internal change

---

### Beat 14: Finale (80-99%)

**What it is:** The climactic sequence where the protagonist executes their new plan, confronts the antagonist (external and internal), and is tested one final time.

**What should happen:** Snyder breaks the Finale into five sub-beats:
1. **Gathering the Team:** The protagonist rallies allies, gathers resources, and prepares.
2. **Executing the Plan:** The new plan is put into action.
3. **High Tower Surprise:** The antagonist reveals a final, unexpected obstacle. The old plan would have failed here.
4. **Dig Deep Down:** The protagonist must use their new understanding (the theme) to overcome the surprise. This is the ultimate test of their transformation.
5. **Execution of the New Plan:** The protagonist succeeds (or fails meaningfully) because of who they have become, not just what they can do.

**Manga/Manhwa application:** This is your climactic arc. In battle manga, each sub-beat can be a chapter. The Gathering is the team reassembling. The Execution is the battle plan in motion. The High Tower Surprise is the villain's final form or hidden power. The Dig Deep Down is the protagonist's transformation-powered breakthrough. In romance, compress these into 1-3 chapters with rising emotional intensity. Use your most dynamic panel compositions, your widest spreads, and your most expressive character art.

**Common mistakes:**
- Resolving the conflict through power alone without demonstrating internal change
- Introducing new information in the finale that was not planted in the setup
- Making the High Tower Surprise feel like a deus ex machina rather than an earned complication
- Letting the finale drag by not escalating through the five sub-beats

---

### Beat 15: Final Image (99-100%)

**What it is:** The mirror of the Opening Image. A snapshot that shows how the protagonist and their world have changed. It is the "after" photograph.

**What should happen:** Show the same type of scene, setting, or visual as the Opening Image, but with the transformation visible. If the story opened on the protagonist alone and failing, it might close on them surrounded by allies and succeeding. If it opened on an empty room, it closes on a full one. The contrast between the two images IS the story.

**Manga/Manhwa application:** Your final panel or page. Make it resonate with the first. If you opened with a solo shot of the protagonist walking away from the viewer, close with them walking toward the viewer, or walking alongside someone. In webtoons, the final scroll should mirror the first. Readers who go back and compare the two should feel the full weight of the journey.

**Common mistakes:**
- Ending on a plot resolution rather than a character-state image
- Failing to mirror the opening (missing the most powerful structural payoff available)
- Adding an epilogue that dilutes the impact of the final image

## Applying the Beat Sheet to Serialized Manga/Manhwa

### Chapter Mapping

For a story planned at approximately 100 chapters:

| Beat | Chapter Range | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Opening Image | Ch. 1 (opening pages) | First impression panel |
| Theme Stated | Ch. 2-3 | Embedded in dialogue |
| Set-Up | Ch. 1-10 | Establish world and cast |
| Catalyst | Ch. 10-12 | End of introductory arc |
| Debate | Ch. 12-20 | Protagonist hesitates |
| Break into Two | Ch. 20 | Major turning point |
| B Story | Ch. 22-25 | New relationship deepens |
| Fun and Games | Ch. 20-50 | Core genre promise |
| Midpoint | Ch. 50 | False victory or false defeat |
| Bad Guys Close In | Ch. 50-75 | Escalation and fracture |
| All Is Lost | Ch. 75 | Devastating low point |
| Dark Night of the Soul | Ch. 75-80 | Emotional aftermath |
| Break into Three | Ch. 80 | New resolve |
| Finale | Ch. 80-99 | Climactic confrontation |
| Final Image | Ch. 100 (final pages) | Mirror of opening |

For shorter works (20-30 chapters), compress proportionally but preserve the percentage ratios. For webtoons with 50-70 panel episodes, each beat may span 1-3 episodes in the early arcs and 3-5 episodes in the finale.

### Key Principles for Visual Storytelling

1. **Give major beats visual weight.** Full-page panels, double-page spreads, color pages, or dramatic composition shifts should mark the Catalyst, Midpoint, All Is Lost, and Finale beats.

2. **Use the beat sheet for arc structure, not just overall structure.** Each major arc within a long-running manga can follow its own compressed beat sheet while the overall story follows the full 15-beat structure.

3. **Plant visually.** If an object, ability, or character will matter later, show it in a panel during the Setup. Manga readers reread -- reward them.

4. **The Midpoint is your secret weapon.** Many manga sag in the middle because the author does not plan a midpoint reversal. A false victory or false defeat at the halfway mark re-energizes the entire second half.

5. **Do not skip the Dark Night of the Soul.** In visual media, silence and stillness are powerful. A quiet chapter after a devastating loss is not wasted space -- it is where the reader emotionally bonds with the protagonist at the deepest level.
