# Show Don't Tell for Visual Media

## The Fundamental Principle

"Show don't tell" means conveying information through **evidence** rather than **declaration**. Instead of stating a fact about a character, situation, or world, you present observable details that allow the reader to arrive at that conclusion themselves.

In prose, this means favoring action, sensory detail, and behavior over summary and explanation. In manga/manhwa, this principle is amplified tenfold because you have an **entire visual channel** dedicated to showing. When art can carry meaning, the text should not repeat it.

**The golden rule for visual media:** If the art shows it, the text should not say it.

## Telling vs. Showing: A Spectrum

Showing and telling are not binary -- they exist on a spectrum. Understanding where each technique falls helps you choose the right approach for each moment.

### Pure Telling (Avoid in Most Cases)
> Narration box: "Kael was a powerful warrior feared by everyone in the kingdom."

The reader is asked to accept this on faith. No evidence. No engagement.

### Telling With Detail (Acceptable for Efficiency)
> Narration box: "Kael had fought in thirty-seven duels. He'd won them all."

Still telling, but now with specific, concrete evidence. The reader draws the conclusion of "powerful and feared."

### Showing Through Character Reaction (Strong)
> Panel: Kael walks into a tavern. Every head turns. A man at the bar drops his mug. The bartender's hand drifts under the counter.

No narration needed. The reader understands Kael's reputation through how others behave around him.

### Showing Through Action (Strongest)
> Panel sequence: An assassin lunges from the shadows. Without looking, Kael catches the blade between two fingers. He continues his conversation.

The reader now has firsthand evidence of Kael's ability. They don't just believe he is powerful -- they have *seen* it.

## Action Over Exposition

### The Character Introduction Test

How a character is introduced sets the reader's relationship with them. Compare:

**Exposition approach:**
> Narration: "Min-ji was the top student at Haesung Academy. Brilliant but lonely, she spent most of her time studying alone."

**Action approach:**
> Panel 1: Min-ji solves a complex equation on the board. The teacher nods, impressed.
> Panel 2: The bell rings. Students cluster into groups, chatting. Min-ji packs her bag alone.
> Panel 3: She eats lunch on a rooftop bench, textbook propped against her knees.

Same information -- top student, brilliant, lonely -- but the reader discovers it through observed behavior. The emotional impact is dramatically different because the reader participated in understanding the character rather than being told what to think.

### Replacing Exposition Dumps

When backstory or world-building information must be communicated, convert it from exposition to experience:

**Exposition:** "The war between the Eastern and Western provinces had been raging for decades, devastating the countryside."

**Environmental showing:** Panels showing:
- A road lined with burned farmhouses, weeds growing through the rubble
- A signpost pointing to two towns, both names crossed out
- Children playing with sticks as swords, mimicking combat stances
- A market where a merchant sells bread for an absurd price, and a customer pays without complaint

Each visual detail implies the war and its consequences without a single line of narration. The reader builds the world in their mind through accumulated evidence.

### The Rule of Three Details

When showing a situation or character trait, three specific visual details are usually sufficient:

1. **First detail:** Establishes the pattern
2. **Second detail:** Confirms the pattern
3. **Third detail:** Cements it and potentially adds nuance

For showing that a character is poor:
1. Patched clothing with frayed edges
2. A meal of plain rice with no side dishes
3. A jar of coins on the shelf, nearly empty, with a label reading "Rent"

Three details. No narration. The reader understands.

## Environmental Storytelling

The environment characters inhabit is one of the most powerful showing tools in visual media, and one of the most underutilized.

### Rooms Tell Stories

Every space a character occupies should communicate something about them:

**A meticulous person's room:**
- Books sorted by color or size
- Desk items arranged at right angles
- Bed made with military precision
- A single framed photo, perfectly level

**A grieving person's room:**
- Dishes piling up in the sink
- Curtains drawn, artificial light only
- A half-eaten meal gone cold on the table
- One side of the bed undisturbed, pillow still fluffed

**A character hiding something:**
- An ordinary room with one locked drawer
- A bookshelf where one book sits spine-inward
- A clean desk with a single folder tucked under papers
- A phone placed face-down

### Weather and Atmosphere as Narrative

Weather and environmental conditions should reinforce or counterpoint the emotional state of the scene:

**Reinforcement (pathetic fallacy):**
- Rain during a funeral or breakup
- Bright sunshine during a celebration
- A storm building as conflict escalates

**Counterpoint (often more interesting):**
- Beautiful sunny day during a devastating revelation -- the world doesn't care about your pain
- A warm, cozy room where a terrible plan is being hatched -- evil doesn't always look evil
- Snow falling gently during a brutal fight -- beauty and violence coexisting

### Objects as Symbols

Recurring objects can carry narrative weight without any dialogue:

- A wilting flower on a windowsill, shown across multiple chapters, tracking the passage of time and declining hope
- A locket that a character touches when stressed -- the reader understands it connects to someone important without being told
- An empty chair at a dinner table -- loss, shown in a single image
- A sword hung on a wall gathering dust -- a violent past deliberately left behind

## Character Expressions as Narrative

In manga/manhwa, facial expressions and body language are primary storytelling tools. They should carry meaning that the dialogue does not explicitly state.

### The Expression-Dialogue Gap

The most powerful character moments in manga come from the gap between what a character says and what their face shows:

- **Smiling while eyes are dead:** False reassurance, hidden pain
- **Calm words, clenched fists:** Suppressed rage
- **Cheerful dialogue, tears forming:** Breaking point reached
- **Casual posture, sharp eyes:** Deception, predatory alertness

This gap is impossible in prose (you would have to "tell" the contradiction). In visual media, it is natural and immediate. Exploit it constantly.

### Micro-Expressions

Small, subtle expression changes between panels can tell an entire emotional story:

Panel 1: Character hears news. Face neutral.
Panel 2: Eyes widen slightly. (Recognition)
Panel 3: Jaw tightens. (Anger forming)
Panel 4: Expression smooths. Slight smile. (Decision to hide the reaction)

Four panels, zero dialogue, complete emotional narrative. The reader tracks the micro-changes and understands the character's internal process.

### Body Language Vocabulary

Different postures and gestures communicate specific states:

**Dominance/Confidence:**
- Wide stance, arms uncrossed
- Chin slightly raised
- Hands in pockets or behind back (exposing chest = no fear)
- Taking up space, spreading out

**Submission/Fear:**
- Shoulders hunched, arms close to body
- Avoiding eye contact, chin tucked
- Making themselves smaller
- Backing against walls or furniture

**Deception:**
- Touching face or neck (self-soothing)
- Slight asymmetry in smile (forced expression)
- Body angled away from the person being deceived
- Over-still posture (conscious control)

**Intimacy/Trust:**
- Mirroring the other person's posture
- Leaning in, reducing physical distance
- Relaxed shoulders, open hands
- Sustained eye contact

### The Silent Page

One of the most powerful techniques in manga: a full page (or in manhwa, a long scroll section) with no dialogue at all. Just expressions, actions, and environment.

Use silent sequences for:
- Processing a major revelation
- The moment before a critical decision
- Grief, awe, or any overwhelming emotion
- A character arriving at a place with deep personal significance
- The aftermath of violence

Silence forces the reader to engage with the art and draw their own emotional conclusions. It is the purest form of "show don't tell."

## When Telling Is Appropriate

Dogmatic adherence to "show don't tell" can produce bloated, inefficient storytelling. There are legitimate reasons to tell:

### Time Compression
When significant time must pass without scene-by-scene coverage:
> "Three months later" (chapter title or time-skip indicator)

Trying to "show" three months passing panel by panel would be absurd.

### Technical Information
When specific facts must be communicated and there is no natural way to show them:
> "The barrier weakens every full moon." (Dialogue from a knowledgeable character)

Some information is genuinely better spoken than demonstrated, especially if demonstrating it would require contrived situations.

### Pacing Control
When a chapter needs to move faster:
> Narration: "They traveled for six days before reaching the capital."

Showing the entire journey would slow the pacing when the story needs to arrive at the destination.

### Establishing Context Quickly
The opening panels of a chapter sometimes need efficient context-setting:
> Text overlay: "District 7 -- The Commercial Quarter"

This is telling, but it is efficient and lets the art focus on character and action rather than spending panels establishing geography.

### The Integration Rule

The best approach often combines showing and telling. The narration provides efficient context; the art provides emotional truth:

> Narration: "It had been a year since the accident."
> Art: Close-up on the character's hand, showing a faded scar. A calendar on the wall with one date circled in red.

The narration tells the time frame. The art shows the lasting impact. Together, they accomplish more than either alone.

## Show Don't Tell Revision Checklist

When reviewing a scene, check for these common telling violations:

1. **Emotion labels in narration:** "She felt sad / angry / scared." Replace with visual/behavioral evidence of the emotion.
2. **Character trait declarations:** "He was brave / clever / cruel." Replace with scenes that demonstrate the trait.
3. **Relationship explanations:** "They were best friends / rivals / in love." Replace with interactions that make the relationship obvious.
4. **Redundant narration:** Art shows a character crying; narration says "Tears rolled down her face." Pick one. In visual media, always pick the art.
5. **Motivation announcements:** "She decided to fight because she wanted to protect her family." Instead, show the family. Show the threat. Show her stepping forward. The reader connects the dots.
6. **History lectures:** Long narration boxes explaining world history or backstory. Convert to environmental details, character dialogue (delivered naturally, not as exposition), or brief flashback panels.
7. **Internal monologue overload:** Characters explaining their own feelings to the reader. If the art is doing its job, the monologue is redundant. Use internal monologue for thoughts the art *cannot* convey -- plans, memories, information the character possesses that no expression could communicate.
