## The 12 Scene Types

### 1. Action

**Purpose:** Advance plot through physical conflict, chase, or combat.
**Pacing:** Fast. Short panels, speed lines, impact frames.
**Panel tips:** Wide panels for establishing the arena, then rapid small panels for exchanges, double-page spreads for climactic hits.
**Dialogue density:** Minimal. Battle cries, short tactics, internal reactions.
**Tension level:** 7-10.

### 2. Dialogue

**Purpose:** Advance plot through conversation, reveal information, develop relationships.
**Pacing:** Medium. Talking heads with reaction shots.
**Panel tips:** Close-ups for emotional weight, medium shots for back-and-forth, establish location early then focus on faces.
**Dialogue density:** High. The core content is the conversation.
**Tension level:** 3-7 (depends on stakes of conversation).

### 3. Flashback

**Purpose:** Reveal backstory, provide context, create emotional resonance with present events.
**Pacing:** Usually slower, dreamlike. Can accelerate for traumatic memories.
**Panel tips:** Distinct visual treatment (different color tone, softer edges, vignettes). Clear entry/exit transitions.
**Dialogue density:** Variable. Often narrated over imagery.
**Tension level:** 3-8.

### 4. Montage

**Purpose:** Compress time, show progression, training, or parallel events.
**Pacing:** Rapid succession of moments. No single moment lingers.
**Panel tips:** Grid layouts, consistent panel sizes, visual rhythm. Each panel is a snapshot from a different moment.
**Dialogue density:** Minimal to none. Narration boxes if needed.
**Tension level:** 3-6.

### 5. Training

**Purpose:** Show character growth, establish power systems, build anticipation.
**Pacing:** Variable — exhaustion cycles (try, fail, rest, breakthrough).
**Panel tips:** Show physical strain, small victories, mentor reactions. End with a demonstration of growth.
**Dialogue density:** Moderate. Instruction, encouragement, internal monologue.
**Tension level:** 4-7.

### 6. Reveal

**Purpose:** Disclose a critical piece of information that changes understanding.
**Pacing:** Slow buildup to the reveal moment, then impact.
**Panel tips:** The reveal itself deserves a full panel or page. Build with small panels leading up, then BOOM — wide shot or close-up on the truth.
**Dialogue density:** Moderate. The reveal line must land perfectly.
**Tension level:** 7-10.

### 7. Confrontation

**Purpose:** Emotional or ideological clash between characters (may not be physical).
**Pacing:** Escalating. Start measured, end explosive.
**Panel tips:** Opposing characters on opposite sides of panels. Dutch angles for instability. Close-ups on eyes during key moments.
**Dialogue density:** High. This is about words as weapons.
**Tension level:** 7-9.

### 8. Chase

**Purpose:** Create urgency through pursuit — physical or metaphorical.
**Pacing:** Breakneck. Constant forward momentum.
**Panel tips:** Horizontal motion, wide panels, tilted frames, obstacles filling panels. Reader's eye should move fast.
**Dialogue density:** Minimal. Gasps, shouts, environmental sounds.
**Tension level:** 7-9.

### 9. Calm Before the Storm

**Purpose:** Create contrast before major conflict. Build dread through normalcy.
**Pacing:** Deliberately slow. Linger on small, warm moments.
**Panel tips:** Peaceful imagery, characters at rest, wide shots of calm environments. The reader should feel "this can't last."
**Dialogue density:** Moderate. Casual, warm, sometimes touching on fears.
**Tension level:** 2-4 (surface), 8+ (dramatic irony if reader knows what's coming).

### 10. Transition

**Purpose:** Bridge between major story beats. Move characters between locations or time periods.
**Pacing:** Brief. Don't linger.
**Panel tips:** Establishing shots, travel montages, time-skip indicators. Can be as short as 1-3 panels.
**Dialogue density:** Low. Brief narration or time markers.
**Tension level:** 2-4.

### 11. Emotional

**Purpose:** Deep character exploration. Processing grief, joy, love, despair.
**Pacing:** Slow, contemplative. Let emotions breathe.
**Panel tips:** Negative space, close-ups on hands/eyes, symbolic imagery, weather reflecting mood. Full-page panels for peak emotion.
**Dialogue density:** Variable. Internal monologue or meaningful silence.
**Tension level:** 3-8 (emotional, not action).

### 12. Worldbuilding

**Purpose:** Establish setting, culture, systems, or lore without heavy plot advancement.
**Pacing:** Measured. Discovery rhythm.
**Panel tips:** Wide establishing shots, cultural details, infographic-style panels for systems. Characters reacting to new environments.
**Dialogue density:** Moderate. Exposition through exploration, not lectures.
**Tension level:** 2-5.

## Scene Type Distribution Guidelines

A well-paced chapter typically contains 3-5 scenes with variety:

- **Action chapter:** Action (40%) + Dialogue (20%) + Emotional (20%) + Transition (20%)
- **Setup chapter:** Worldbuilding (30%) + Dialogue (30%) + Calm (20%) + Transition (20%)
- **Climax chapter:** Confrontation (30%) + Action (30%) + Reveal (20%) + Emotional (20%)
- **Recovery chapter:** Emotional (40%) + Dialogue (30%) + Calm (20%) + Training (10%)

Avoid more than 3 consecutive scenes of the same type. Readers need rhythm shifts to stay engaged.
