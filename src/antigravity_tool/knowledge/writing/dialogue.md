# Dialogue Writing Techniques

## Core Principle: Every Line Must Earn Its Place

Dialogue in fiction -- and especially in manga/manhwa -- must do at least one of the following:

1. **Reveal character** (personality, values, emotional state)
2. **Advance the plot** (deliver new information, trigger decisions)
3. **Build tension** (create conflict, raise stakes, deepen mystery)
4. **Establish or shift relationships** (show power dynamics, intimacy, hostility)

If a line of dialogue does none of these, cut it. Greetings, small talk, and transitional pleasantries ("Hello," "How are you?") should almost never appear unless they carry subtext or deliberate characterization.

## Purpose-Driven Dialogue

### The Intent Layer

Before writing any dialogue exchange, identify the **intent** of each speaker:

- **What does this character want right now?** (immediate goal)
- **What do they want the other person to do or feel?** (persuasion target)
- **What are they hiding?** (withheld information or emotion)

Characters rarely say exactly what they mean. The gap between intent and expression is where compelling dialogue lives.

### Information Management

Control what the reader learns through dialogue by asking:

- Does the reader already know this? (Avoid redundant exposition.)
- Does the character have a reason to say this aloud? (Avoid "as you know, Bob" syndrome.)
- Could this information be shown visually instead? (In manga, prefer visual delivery.)

**Bad:**
> "As you know, the demon king destroyed our village ten years ago and killed my parents."

**Better:**
> "Ten years. And I still can't walk past the eastern ruins without smelling smoke."

The second version conveys the same backstory but through personal, sensory experience rather than exposition dump.

## Subtext: What Lives Beneath the Words

Subtext is the unspoken meaning carried beneath surface dialogue. It is the single most important element that separates professional-quality dialogue from amateur writing.

### Techniques for Building Subtext

**1. Deflection and Avoidance**
Characters talk around the real subject. A character asked "Do you still love him?" might respond with "The soup is getting cold." The avoidance *is* the answer.

**2. Contradiction Between Words and Action**
A character says "I'm fine" while their hands are shaking. In manga, this is especially powerful because the art can show what the words deny.

**3. Loaded Ordinary Statements**
After a betrayal, a character says: "You always did prefer the window seat." Mundane words carrying enormous emotional weight because of context.

**4. Selective Honesty**
A character reveals one truth to hide a bigger one. "Yes, I was at the warehouse last night" (true) -- to avoid revealing *why* they were there.

**5. Power Plays Through Language**
- Using someone's full name instead of a nickname signals distance or anger
- Switching from informal to formal speech (especially relevant in Korean/Japanese) signals emotional shift
- Interrupting, finishing someone's sentences, or refusing to respond are all power moves

### Subtext in Manga/Manhwa Context

In visual media, subtext gets a massive amplifier: the art. A character's spoken words can be directly contradicted by:
- Their facial expression
- Their body language
- What they're doing with their hands
- Background elements or visual metaphors
- The panel composition itself (isolated character = emotional distance)

Always consider the **text-image gap** -- the space between what's said and what's shown. This gap is one of the most powerful storytelling tools in sequential art.

## Voice Differentiation

Every character should sound distinct enough that a reader could identify the speaker without dialogue tags. Voice is built from multiple layers:

### Vocabulary Level

- **Educated/formal character:** Complex sentence structures, precise word choices, complete sentences
- **Street-smart character:** Slang, contractions, dropped words, colloquialisms
- **Child character:** Simple vocabulary, literal interpretations, non sequiturs
- **Technical character:** Jargon-heavy, precise but socially awkward phrasing

### Sentence Structure

- **Confident character:** Short, declarative sentences. Commands. Fragments.
- **Anxious character:** Run-on sentences, self-corrections, qualifiers ("maybe," "sort of," "I think")
- **Calculating character:** Measured, complete sentences with conditional clauses
- **Impulsive character:** Exclamations, interrupted thoughts, topic jumps

### Speech Rhythm

- **Deliberate speaker:** Even pacing, pauses (shown with ellipsis or beat panels)
- **Rapid speaker:** Stacked dialogue bubbles, minimal punctuation breaks
- **Dramatic speaker:** Build-up followed by punchy declarations

### Cultural and Social Markers

In manhwa especially, speech levels (formal/informal Korean) carry enormous social meaning. When writing for translation or in English approximation:

- Use contractions vs. full forms to signal formality level
- First name vs. surname vs. title usage maps to intimacy/respect levels
- Honorifics (if used) should be consistent and character-appropriate

## Speech Patterns and Verbal Tics

Verbal tics must be used with restraint. They are seasoning, not the main course.

### Effective Verbal Tics

- **Catchphrases:** A character's signature line used sparingly (2-3 times per arc, not every chapter). The impact comes from rarity.
- **Filler words:** One character says "look" before explanations; another says "listen." Small but distinguishing.
- **Sentence-ending habits:** One character trails off with "..."; another always finishes with certainty.
- **Metaphor families:** A sailor character frames everything in nautical terms. A cook uses food metaphors. This should feel natural, not forced.
- **Code-switching:** A character speaks differently to different people -- formal with authority figures, casual with friends, cold with enemies. This reveals social intelligence and relationship dynamics.

### Common Mistakes with Verbal Tics

- **Overuse:** If a tic appears in every single dialogue line, it becomes noise. Use it in 1 out of every 4-5 lines at most.
- **Inconsistency:** If you establish a tic, maintain it. Readers notice when it disappears.
- **Meaningless tics:** Every tic should hint at character psychology. A character who always says "honestly" might be habitually dishonest. A character who says "whatever" is performing indifference.

## Beats Over Tags

### What Are Dialogue Beats?

A **beat** is a small action interspersed with dialogue that replaces or supplements a dialogue tag ("said," "asked," "exclaimed").

**Tag-heavy:**
> "I don't think that's a good idea," she said nervously.
> "Why not?" he asked aggressively.

**Beat-driven:**
> "I don't think that's a good idea." She pulled at a loose thread on her sleeve.
> He stepped closer. "Why not?"

Beats accomplish three things simultaneously:
1. Identify the speaker (no tag needed)
2. Show emotional state through action (not told through adverbs)
3. Control pacing (beats create natural pauses)

### Beats in Manga/Manhwa Screenplay Format

In manga scripts, beats translate directly into visual direction:

```
PANEL: Close-up on Mira's hands gripping the table edge.
MIRA: "I don't think that's a good idea."

PANEL: Jae-won steps into her personal space, looming.
JAE-WON: "Why not?"
```

The beat becomes the panel's visual content, and the dialogue sits within it. This is the natural fusion point between prose writing and visual scripting.

### When Tags Are Still Appropriate

- "Said" and "asked" are invisible -- use them freely when beats would slow the pace
- During rapid-fire exchanges, drop both tags and beats; let the dialogue volley
- Use non-standard tags ("whispered," "shouted") only when the volume/delivery genuinely matters and cannot be shown visually

## Manga/Manhwa Dialogue Conventions

Sequential art imposes specific constraints on dialogue that prose does not:

### Shorter Is Almost Always Better

- **Bubble space is limited.** A speech bubble that dominates a panel suffocates the art.
- **Target: 1-2 sentences per bubble.** Three sentences is the practical maximum.
- **If dialogue runs long, break it across multiple bubbles** within the same panel or across panels.

### Punchier Phrasing

Manga dialogue favors impact over nuance:

**Prose version:**
> "I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, and I've come to the conclusion that you might have been right about everything."

**Manga version:**
> "You were right." / "About all of it."

Two bubbles. Same meaning. Ten times the impact.

### The Power of Silence

In manga, what characters *don't* say is often more powerful than what they do:

- **Empty speech bubbles** (with just "..." ) convey hesitation, shock, or emotional overwhelm
- **Panels with no dialogue at all** let the art carry the emotional weight
- **A character turning away without responding** can be more devastating than any words

### Dialogue Placement and Reading Flow

- Dialogue should follow the natural reading direction (right-to-left for manga, left-to-right/top-to-bottom for manhwa/webtoon)
- The first speaker in a panel should have their bubble positioned to be read first
- Avoid crossing bubble tails (the pointer from bubble to character)
- Leave room for the art to breathe -- do not fill every panel with text

### Sound Effects and Exclamations

- Sound effects (SFX) are part of the visual language, not traditional dialogue
- Exclamations should be used deliberately: one "!!" per scene has impact; five per page has none
- Internal monologue boxes should be visually distinct from spoken dialogue bubbles
- Narration boxes are a separate layer -- use them sparingly to avoid over-explaining what the art shows

## Dialogue Revision Checklist

When reviewing dialogue, ask:

1. **Can I identify the speaker without tags?** If not, the voices are too similar.
2. **Does every line serve a purpose?** Cut anything that is purely transactional.
3. **Is there subtext?** If characters say exactly what they mean in every line, the dialogue is flat.
4. **Is it short enough for bubbles?** Read it aloud. If you run out of breath, it is too long.
5. **Does the dialogue match the character's current emotional state?** A terrified character should not speak in calm, complete paragraphs.
6. **Are beats and actions doing work?** Replace adverb-laden tags with physical behavior.
7. **Does the exchange have shape?** Dialogue scenes need their own arc -- an opening state, escalation or shift, and a landing point that differs from the start.
