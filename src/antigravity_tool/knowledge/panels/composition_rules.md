# Composition Rules and Techniques

Composition is the arrangement of visual elements within a single panel. While layout determines the architecture of the page or scroll, composition determines the internal structure of each panel -- where subjects are placed, how the reader's eye moves, what is emphasized, and what is subordinated. Strong composition transforms a panel from a simple illustration into a narrative instrument.

---

## 1. Rule of Thirds

### The Principle
Divide the panel into a 3x3 grid using two equally-spaced horizontal lines and two equally-spaced vertical lines. The four points where these lines intersect are called **power points** or **crash points**. Placing the most important visual element at or near a power point creates a composition that feels balanced yet dynamic.

### Why It Works
The human eye does not naturally rest at the center of a frame. Centering a subject creates a static, often lifeless composition. The rule of thirds places the subject off-center, which creates visual tension (the eye is drawn to the subject but has room to explore the rest of the frame) and a sense of natural balance (the subject is weighted against the empty space on the opposite side).

### Application in Manga/Manhwa Panels

**Character placement**: In a dialogue panel, place the character's eyes at one of the upper power points. This gives the face prominence while leaving space for speech bubbles and background context.

**Horizon lines**: In establishing shots, place the horizon along one of the horizontal third-lines -- upper third for emphasis on the ground/foreground, lower third for emphasis on the sky/background.

**Action direction**: Place a moving character at one of the side power points with the majority of empty space in the direction they are moving. This creates a sense of trajectory and momentum. A character running rightward should be placed at the left-third with open space to the right.

**Gaze direction**: If a character is looking to the left, place them on the right side of the panel. The empty space on the left becomes the "space they are looking at," which the reader interprets as significant.

### When to Break the Rule
- **Center composition**: Placing a subject dead center creates a feeling of confrontation, formality, symmetry, or iconic stillness. Use for: character spreads, frontal stares, balanced poses, ritualistic or ceremonial scenes.
- **Edge/corner placement**: Pushing a subject to the extreme edge or corner creates unease, imbalance, or the sense that the character is being pushed out of their own story. Use for: isolation, marginalization, psychological distress.
- **Filling the frame**: A close-up or extreme close-up that fills the entire panel breaks the rule of thirds because there is no negative space. This is intentional and creates overwhelming presence.

## 2. Leading Lines

### The Principle
Lines within the panel -- whether literal (architectural edges, roads, weapons, limbs) or implied (gaze direction, motion trajectory, light beams) -- guide the reader's eye along a path. The artist controls where the reader looks and in what order by arranging these lines deliberately.

### Types of Leading Lines

**Architectural lines**: Walls, floors, ceilings, corridors, roads, bridges. These are the most visible leading lines and can be engineered into any environment.

**Body lines**: A character's extended arm, a pointed finger, the line of a leg in motion, the direction of a turned head. The human body is a collection of leading lines that the reader instinctively follows.

**Gaze lines**: Where a character's eyes are looking. Readers follow a character's gaze automatically. If a character stares at something, the reader stares at it too.

**Motion lines (speed lines)**: The drawn motion trails behind a moving object or character. These are explicit directional indicators unique to manga/manhwa.

**Environmental lines**: Rain falling, wind-blown hair, light streaming through windows, cracks in the ground. These subtler lines create atmospheric direction.

**Weapon lines**: A sword's blade, an arrow's shaft, a gun's barrel. These are among the strongest leading lines because they imply force and consequence along their trajectory.

### Application in Manga/Manhwa Panels

**Guide the eye to the focal point**: Arrange lines so they converge on the panel's most important element. A corridor's perspective lines converging on a character standing at the far end. A circle of swords pointing at a character in the center.

**Connect panels**: A leading line in one panel can point toward the next panel in reading order, creating a visual bridge that smooths the reader's transition between panels. A character's gaze directed toward the right edge of a panel naturally pushes the reader's eye to the next panel (in left-to-right reading) or the panel below (in vertical scroll).

**Create depth**: Leading lines that converge toward a vanishing point create perspective and three-dimensional space within a flat panel.

**Direct action reading**: In a fight scene, the trajectory of a punch should lead from the attacker to the defender. The reader's eye follows the fist's path and arrives at the impact, experiencing the hit in real time.

### Common Mistakes
- **Lines leading off-panel or to nothing**: If leading lines point to an empty area with no subject, the reader's eye falls off the panel and loses engagement.
- **Competing lines**: Multiple leading lines pointing in different directions without a clear hierarchy create visual chaos. The reader's eye bounces between them without settling.
- **Lines leading against reading direction**: In manga (right-to-left), dominant leading lines pointing to the right push the reader's eye backward against reading flow. In webtoon (top-to-bottom), strong upward-pointing lines fight the scroll direction. These can be used intentionally for disorientation, but are mistakes when unintentional.

## 3. Framing (Frame-within-a-Frame)

### The Principle
Using elements within the panel to create a secondary frame around the subject. Doorways, windows, arches, branches, arms, crowds, shadows, or any visual element that forms a border around the focal point.

### Why It Works
The internal frame isolates the subject from the surrounding visual information, drawing the reader's eye inward. It creates a sense of voyeurism (the reader is peering through something to see the subject), confinement (the subject is trapped or enclosed), or focus (the subject is highlighted against a busy or complex background).

### Types of Framing

**Architectural framing**: A character seen through a doorway, window, arch, or gate. The structure frames the character like a painting within a painting.

**Natural framing**: Trees, branches, cave openings, or natural formations creating a border. Used for outdoor scenes and fantasy/adventure settings.

**Character framing**: One character's body (silhouette, arm, shoulder) frames another character. This creates a power dynamic where the framing character controls or observes the framed character.

**Shadow framing**: A pool of light surrounded by darkness, or vice versa. The character exists in a visual spotlight.

**Object framing**: A mirror, a picture frame, a screen, a scope, binoculars. The character is seen through or within an object, which adds a layer of context (surveillance through a scope, self-reflection in a mirror).

### Application in Manga/Manhwa

**Isolation**: Frame a lonely character in a doorway or window to emphasize their separation from the world.

**Surveillance/voyeurism**: Show a character being observed by framing them through the observer's position (between bars, through a keyhole, in a reflection).

**Transition between spaces**: Frame a character standing at a threshold (doorway, gate, bridge) to visually represent their transition between two states, places, or phases of the story.

**Horror**: Frame a character in a narrow space (hallway, crack, between objects) to create claustrophobia and the sense of being trapped.

## 4. Visual Hierarchy

### The Principle
Not all elements in a panel are equally important. Visual hierarchy is the system by which the artist ensures the reader sees the most important element first, the second most important element second, and so on. It is the ranking of visual attention.

### Tools for Creating Hierarchy

**Size**: Larger elements attract attention before smaller ones. The biggest thing in the panel is usually the most important.

**Contrast**: Elements with the highest contrast against their surroundings attract attention first. A dark figure against a light background. A bright object in a dark scene. A colored element in a monochrome panel.

**Detail**: More detailed elements attract attention before less detailed ones. A fully rendered face surrounded by sketchy, simplified backgrounds focuses the reader on the face.

**Position**: Elements at power points (rule of thirds intersections) or at the center of converging leading lines receive more attention.

**Isolation**: An element surrounded by empty space receives more attention than an element crowded by other elements.

**Focus/blur**: Sharp elements attract attention over blurry or soft elements. Manga achieves this through line weight variation (sharp precise lines for the subject, looser or lighter lines for the background).

**Overlap**: Elements in front of other elements (overlapping them) are perceived as closer and more important.

### Application in Manga/Manhwa Panels

**Character vs. background**: The character should almost always be the highest-hierarchy element. Use heavier line weights for characters, lighter for backgrounds. Use detail density differences. In color manhwa, characters are often rendered with more saturated colors than backgrounds.

**Speech bubble hierarchy**: The most important dialogue should be in the largest or most prominently placed speech bubble. In scenes with multiple speakers, hierarchy determines whose words the reader processes first.

**Focal character in group scenes**: When multiple characters are in frame, the focal character should be distinguished through size, position, contrast, or detail. Common technique: the focal character is in sharp focus while others are slightly simplified or faded.

**Action emphasis**: In a combat panel, the impact point (where the fist meets the face, where the blade strikes) should be the highest-hierarchy element. Use contrast effects (impact flashes, radiating lines) to draw the eye there first.

### Common Mistakes
- **Equal hierarchy for all elements**: If everything is rendered with equal detail, size, and contrast, nothing stands out and the reader's eye wanders without purpose.
- **Background overpowering subject**: Overly detailed or complex backgrounds can compete with or overwhelm the character.
- **Text competing with art**: Speech bubbles placed over the most visually important area of the panel.

## 5. Reading Direction and Visual Flow

### The Fundamental Difference

**Manga (Japanese)**: Read right-to-left, top-to-bottom. The reader's eye enters the panel at the top-right and exits at the bottom-left. All composition must account for this flow.

**Manhwa (Korean)**: Traditionally read left-to-right, top-to-bottom (same as Western comics). The reader's eye enters at the top-left and exits at the bottom-right.

**Webtoon (Korean vertical scroll)**: Read top-to-bottom. Horizontal reading direction within panels is left-to-right. The primary flow is vertical -- downward through the scroll.

### Composing for Reading Direction

#### Manga (Right-to-Left)
- **Place the first thing the reader should see at the top-right of the panel**.
- **Place the last thing (the emotional beat, the punchline, the reveal) at the bottom-left**.
- **Character facing direction matters**: A character facing left is facing "forward" in manga reading flow. A character facing right is facing "backward" against the flow, which creates a subtle sense of resistance, confrontation, or looking back.
- **Speech bubble placement**: The first bubble read should be at the top-right; the response bubble should be lower and to the left. Reversing this order confuses the reading sequence.
- **Action direction**: A punch thrown from right to left follows reading flow and feels natural and fast. A punch thrown from left to right goes against reading flow and feels resistant, defiant, or counterattacking.

#### Manhwa (Left-to-Right)
- **Mirror of manga conventions**: First-read position is top-left; last-read position is bottom-right.
- **Character facing right is facing "forward"**; facing left is facing "backward."
- **Speech bubbles flow left-to-right**, top-to-bottom.
- **Leftward action (attacking from right to left) feels like retreating or being pushed back**; rightward action feels aggressive and progressive.

#### Webtoon (Vertical Scroll)
- **Vertical flow dominates**: The reader's eye moves primarily downward. Horizontal composition matters within panels, but the most important axis is vertical.
- **Place reveals and key information below**, not to the side. The reader will encounter them as they scroll.
- **Use vertical leading lines** (falling objects, tall structures, dripping liquids) to align with the scroll direction and pull the reader downward.
- **Avoid strong upward-pointing compositions** in webtoons unless intentionally creating a sense of resistance to the reading flow.
- **Speech bubbles in webtoons should stack vertically** rather than spread horizontally. The reader's eye should not have to scan left-right-left-right; it should move naturally downward.

### Panel-to-Panel Flow

The exit point of one panel should lead naturally to the entry point of the next panel:
- In manga: the bottom-left of Panel 1 should visually connect to the top-right of Panel 2 (or top-right of the next row).
- In manhwa/Western: the bottom-right of Panel 1 leads to the top-left of Panel 2.
- In webtoon: the bottom of Panel 1 leads to the top of Panel 2 (directly below).

**Techniques for smooth panel transitions**:
- A character's gaze at the exit point of Panel 1 aims toward the entry point of Panel 2.
- Motion in Panel 1 continues visually in Panel 2 (a character falling in Panel 1 is still falling in Panel 2 below).
- Color or tonal continuity: the exit edge of Panel 1 has similar values to the entry edge of Panel 2.

## 6. Eye Movement Guidance

### The Principle
The artist must control the reader's eye movement within each panel and between panels. An uncontrolled eye wanders, gets confused, and disengages. A guided eye experiences the story in the order and at the pace the artist intends.

### The Eye Movement Sequence
For any panel, design the eye to follow this path:
1. **Entry point**: Where the eye enters the panel (determined by reading direction and the previous panel's exit point).
2. **Primary subject**: The most important element, which the eye should reach first via leading lines, contrast, or position.
3. **Secondary elements**: Supporting information (reactions, context, background details) that the eye picks up after the primary subject.
4. **Exit point**: Where the eye leaves the panel, aimed toward the next panel in reading order.

### Techniques for Guiding Eye Movement

**Contrast anchoring**: The highest-contrast element in the panel grabs the eye first. Place your primary subject at the highest-contrast point.

**Size anchoring**: The largest element grabs attention. Use size to establish the first thing the reader sees.

**Path of detail**: The eye follows increasing or decreasing detail. A path of detailed rendering that runs from the entry point to the focal point guides the eye along it.

**Character gaze**: If a character is looking at something, the reader looks at it too. This is the most powerful and natural eye-movement tool. Chain character gazes across a panel to create a complex eye path: Character A looks at Character B, who looks at Object C. The reader follows: A then B then C.

**Gesture and body direction**: Pointed fingers, extended arms, leaning bodies, and turned heads all direct the reader's eye along their vector.

**Speech bubble placement**: Readers in manga/manhwa read text before (or simultaneously with) images. A speech bubble at the entry point ensures the reader processes the words first, then scans the image. A speech bubble at the exit point ensures the reader absorbs the image before the dialogue.

**Speed lines and effects**: Radiating lines, impact effects, and motion trails are explicit directional markers. They point the eye along the path of action.

### Common Eye-Movement Problems

**The dead center trap**: A composition that draws the eye to the center and provides no path onward. The eye arrives and sits. To fix: add a leading element (a gaze, a line, a gesture) pointing from the center toward the exit point.

**The exit-less panel**: A composition with no clear exit point. The eye bounces around the panel without finding a way to move to the next panel. To fix: ensure some element (a line, a gaze, a motion) points toward the reading-direction exit edge.

**The premature exit**: A strong leading line or high-contrast element near the exit edge pulls the eye out of the panel before it has absorbed the primary subject. To fix: ensure the primary subject has higher visual hierarchy than the exit-edge element.

## 7. Negative Space (White Space / Empty Space)

### The Principle
Negative space is the area within a panel that is empty or visually quiet -- containing no subjects, no detail, and minimal or no visual information. It is not wasted space; it is active space that performs specific narrative and emotional functions.

### Functions of Negative Space

#### Emotional Breathing Room
Dense, detail-packed panels feel intense, busy, and claustrophobic. Panels with generous negative space feel calm, open, contemplative, or melancholy. Negative space is emotional breathing room -- it allows the reader to process the content of the panel without being overwhelmed.

**Application**: After an intense action sequence (dense panels, maximum detail), a panel with large amounts of negative space provides a visual and emotional exhale.

#### Isolation and Loneliness
A character surrounded by empty space feels alone. The more negative space around a character, the more isolated they appear. This is one of the most powerful techniques in manga for conveying loneliness, loss, or abandonment.

**Application**: A character standing in the center of a panel that is 70-80% empty white space, with no background detail. The reader instantly feels their aloneness.

#### Emphasis Through Contrast
An element surrounded by negative space has nothing competing for attention. It becomes the sole focus. Negative space acts as a visual spotlight.

**Application**: A single dialogue line in a panel that is mostly empty. A single hand reaching out from a field of white. A single eye in an otherwise blank panel. The isolation of the element amplifies its importance.

#### Temporal Expansion
Empty space within a panel makes time feel like it is stretching. A moment lingers. The reader dwells in the quiet.

**Application**: A character's face in profile, placed at one edge of the panel with the rest of the panel empty. The silence is visible. The reader feels the duration of the pause.

#### Elegance and Sophistication
Generous negative space is associated with visual sophistication. It communicates confidence -- the artist is confident enough to leave space unused, trusting that the essential elements carry the panel.

**Application**: Shoujo manga and high-end manhwa use negative space extensively. Flowery backgrounds in shoujo are actually a form of decorative negative space -- the flowers are not environment; they are emotional atmosphere filling the space around the character.

### Negative Space in Manga vs. Webtoon

**Manga**: Negative space exists within panels and in the margins (white space outside panel borders). Borderless panels that bleed into white page space convert the entire margin into emotionally active negative space.

**Webtoon**: The scroll gaps between panels function as negative space. The background color of the canvas itself (usually white, sometimes black or colored) is a constant field of negative space that surrounds every panel. Webtoon artists can manipulate this by:
- Changing the canvas background color for atmospheric effect.
- Increasing scroll gaps to create temporal/emotional pauses.
- Using borderless panels that blend into the canvas, making the negative space feel infinite.

### Black Negative Space
While negative space is often white, it can be black (or any dark value). Black negative space conveys: darkness, oppression, the unknown, fear, confinement, or dramatic intensity. A character lit against pure black is in a fundamentally different emotional context than a character against pure white.

**Application in horror**: Black negative space is a staple of horror manga. The darkness around a character is active threat -- the reader knows something could be lurking in it.

**Application in dramatic manga**: A character silhouetted against black, with only their eyes or a key feature visible, creates maximum drama and mystery.

### Balancing Negative and Positive Space

**General guideline**: Panels should have a clear ratio of positive space (content) to negative space (empty). This ratio communicates mood:
- **High positive, low negative** (80/20): Dense, intense, overwhelming. Used for action, horror, and visually complex environments.
- **Balanced** (50/50): Comfortable, readable, neutral. The standard for most dialogue and narrative panels.
- **Low positive, high negative** (20/80): Sparse, contemplative, emotional, elegant. Used for dramatic pauses, loneliness, and atmospheric beats.

**Consistency within scenes**: The positive/negative ratio should remain relatively consistent within a scene to maintain tonal consistency. A sudden shift in ratio signals a tonal change -- which should be intentional.

---

## 8. Depth and Layering

### The Principle
Panels exist on a flat surface, but effective composition creates the illusion of three-dimensional depth using foreground, midground, and background layers. Depth makes panels feel immersive rather than flat and diagrammatic.

### Creating Depth

**Foreground elements**: Objects or details in the immediate front of the panel -- a hand, a railing, a plant, debris. These elements overlap the midground, establishing that things exist at different distances from the "camera."

**Midground subjects**: The primary subject of the panel (usually the character or action) occupying the middle depth layer.

**Background context**: The environment behind the subject -- walls, sky, landscape, architecture.

**Atmospheric perspective**: Elements farther from the camera are lighter in value, less detailed, and lower in contrast. Elements closer to the camera are darker, more detailed, and higher in contrast. This mimics how air affects visibility in reality.

**Overlap**: When one element overlaps another, the overlapping element is perceived as closer. Extensive overlapping creates a strong sense of layered depth.

**Scale diminution**: Objects farther away appear smaller. Consistent scale diminution across a panel creates convincing depth.

### Application in Manga/Manhwa
- Place a foreground element (a shoulder, a wall edge, an object) at the panel's edge to create an instant depth layer.
- Use speed lines and effects that radiate outward from an impact point to create implied depth (the lines appear to come "toward" the reader).
- In webtoon, the fixed-width format can feel flat. Combat this by consistently using at least two depth layers (foreground framing + midground subject, or midground subject + detailed background).
- Over-the-shoulder shots are inherently depth-creating compositions because the foreground character and background character establish two clear depth layers.

---

## 9. Contrast and Tonal Composition

### The Principle
The distribution of light and dark values across a panel creates mood, guides the eye, and establishes hierarchy. Even in color manhwa, the underlying tonal structure (light vs. dark) is the foundation of readable composition.

### Tonal Approaches

**High-key composition**: Dominated by light values with small areas of dark. Feels open, airy, peaceful, or innocent. Common in slice-of-life, romance, and comedic scenes.

**Low-key composition**: Dominated by dark values with small areas of light. Feels oppressive, dramatic, mysterious, or dangerous. Common in horror, thriller, and climactic battle scenes.

**High-contrast composition**: Both very light and very dark values with minimal mid-tones. Feels dramatic, stark, and powerful. Common in action manga and noir-influenced works.

**Low-contrast composition**: Values clustered around mid-tones with neither extreme lights nor extreme darks. Feels subdued, melancholic, or dreamlike. Common in atmospheric and contemplative scenes.

### Application in Manga/Manhwa
- Use tonal contrast to isolate the primary subject: dark character on light background, or light character on dark background.
- In black-and-white manga, screen tones (dot patterns creating gray values) provide the mid-tone range. Strategic placement of screen tones creates the desired tonal composition.
- In color manhwa, color temperature (warm vs. cool) works alongside value contrast to guide the eye and set mood.
- Transition between tonal approaches to mirror narrative progression: a scene that begins high-key and shifts to low-key as danger approaches tells the story through tone alone.

## 10. Putting It All Together: Composition Checklist

When composing a panel, work through these questions:

1. **What is the single most important element in this panel?** (This determines your focal point.)
2. **Where does the reader's eye enter this panel?** (Determined by reading direction and previous panel.)
3. **How does the eye reach the focal point from the entry point?** (Leading lines, contrast, gaze direction.)
4. **What is the power dynamic or emotional tone?** (Determines camera angle, subject position, negative space ratio.)
5. **Is the subject at a rule-of-thirds position, or intentionally centered/offset?** (Intentionality is key.)
6. **What guides the eye to the exit point?** (Toward the next panel in reading order.)
7. **Is there clear visual hierarchy?** (Primary subject > secondary elements > background.)
8. **Does the negative space serve a purpose?** (Breathing room, isolation, emphasis, elegance.)
9. **Does the tonal composition support the mood?** (High-key, low-key, high-contrast, low-contrast.)
10. **Does the composition align with reading direction?** (R-to-L for manga, L-to-R for manhwa, top-to-bottom for webtoon.)

No panel needs to satisfy all of these perfectly. But considering each one during composition ensures intentional, effective panel construction rather than defaulting to instinct alone.
