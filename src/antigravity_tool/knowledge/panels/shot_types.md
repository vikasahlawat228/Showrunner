# Shot Types Taxonomy

A complete reference for shot types used in manga and manhwa/webtoon panel composition. Shot type is the single most important decision when constructing a panel -- it determines what information the reader receives, how they feel, and how they connect to the characters and world.

## 1. Extreme Wide Shot (EWS) / Establishing Shot

### What It Shows
The full environment with characters appearing very small or absent entirely. Buildings, landscapes, cityscapes, battlefields -- the world itself is the subject.

### When to Use
- **Scene openings**: Establish location at the start of a new scene or chapter.
- **Time transitions**: Show that time has passed (day to night, season change).
- **Scale emphasis**: Convey the enormity of a setting -- a castle, a battlefield, a city skyline.
- **Isolation/insignificance**: Make a character feel small against the world.
- **Aftermath**: Show destruction or consequences spread across a wide area.

### Emotional Effect
Awe, loneliness, insignificance, wonder, dread, or calm depending on context. The reader is pulled out of character interiority and made to feel the weight of the world around them.

### Recommended Panel Size
**Large to full-page**. This shot demands space. In manga, it frequently occupies a full page or a half-page horizontal strip. In webtoon format, it works as a full-width panel with generous vertical height, sometimes spanning the equivalent of two or three phone screens.

### Manga/Manhwa Conventions
- Manga: Often used as the first panel of a chapter or after a page turn for maximum reveal impact. Tite Kubo (Bleach) and Kentaro Miura (Berserk) are masters of the environmental establishing shot.
- Manhwa/Webtoon: Full-width panels that force the reader to pause scrolling. Solo Leveling uses extreme wide shots of dungeon interiors to establish threat scale. Tower of God uses them to convey the alien vastness of each floor.

## 2. Wide Shot (WS) / Long Shot / Full Shot

### What It Shows
A character's full body from head to toe, with significant environment visible around them. The character and their surroundings are given roughly equal visual weight.

### When to Use
- **Character introductions**: Show a character's full design, posture, and outfit for the first time.
- **Action choreography**: Display full-body movement -- fighting stances, running, dancing, falling.
- **Spatial relationships**: Show how characters relate to each other and to the environment physically.
- **Power reveals**: A character standing in a transformed state, aura visible, full body on display.

### Emotional Effect
Neutral to dramatic depending on pose and context. Provides clarity and objectivity. The reader can assess the full situation without being drawn into a character's specific emotion.

### Recommended Panel Size
**Medium to large**. Needs enough room to render the full body with readable detail. In webtoon, this typically means full-width or three-quarter width.

### Manga/Manhwa Conventions
- Manga: Standard shot for fight scenes. One Piece uses wide shots extensively for crew poses and battle formations. The "character stands dramatically" panel is almost always a wide shot.
- Manhwa/Webtoon: Frequently used for full-body character reveals with detailed costume/equipment rendering. Lookism and Windbreaker use wide shots to show off character fashion and physique.

## 3. Medium Wide Shot (MWS) / Cowboy Shot / American Shot

### What It Shows
A character from roughly the knees or mid-thigh up. Named "cowboy shot" because it was framed to show the gun holster in Western films.

### When to Use
- **Walking/entering scenes**: Show a character moving into a space with enough body language visible.
- **Casual interaction**: Two characters talking while standing -- enough body to read posture, enough face to read expression.
- **Weapon/tool display**: When a character is holding something important at their side (a sword, a bag, a phone).
- **Transition shot**: Bridge between wide and medium shots to ease a visual zoom.

### Emotional Effect
Comfortable and natural. This framing matches roughly how we perceive people in real social interaction from a conversational distance. It feels neither distant nor intimate.

### Recommended Panel Size
**Medium**. Works in standard rectangular panels. Does not demand extra space but should not be crammed into tiny panels either.

### Manga/Manhwa Conventions
- Manga: Common in slice-of-life and romance genres for walking-and-talking scenes. Frequently used in shonen when characters are confronting each other before a fight begins.
- Manhwa/Webtoon: A workhorse shot in webtoons, especially for dialogue-heavy scenes in office, school, or urban settings.

## 4. Medium Shot (MS)

### What It Shows
A character from approximately the waist up. The character's face, upper body, and hand gestures are all clearly visible, while the environment is reduced to background context.

### When to Use
- **Dialogue**: The default shot for conversation. Expressive enough to convey emotion, wide enough to include gestures.
- **Reactions**: Show a character reacting to news, an event, or another character's words.
- **Decision moments**: A character steeling themselves, clenching a fist, reaching for something.
- **Group shots**: Fit two or three characters in frame during a conversation.

### Emotional Effect
Balanced engagement. The reader connects with the character personally without overwhelming intimacy. This is the "neutral gear" of visual storytelling -- it neither pushes the reader away nor pulls them uncomfortably close.

### Recommended Panel Size
**Small to medium**. Highly versatile. Works in almost any panel size and shape, which makes it the most commonly used shot in both manga and manhwa.

### Manga/Manhwa Conventions
- Manga: The backbone of dialogue scenes across all genres. Eiichiro Oda, Gosho Aoyama, and virtually every mangaka default to medium shots for conversation.
- Manhwa/Webtoon: Equally fundamental. Webtoon creators often alternate between medium shots and close-ups in rapid sequence during emotional dialogue.

## 5. Medium Close-Up (MCU)

### What It Shows
A character from the chest or shoulders up. The face dominates the frame but the shoulders and upper chest provide context for body language (shrugging, turning away, tensing up).

### When to Use
- **Emotional dialogue**: When the words being spoken carry significant weight and the reader needs to see the emotion on the speaker's face.
- **Internal monologue**: A character thinking or reflecting.
- **Subtle reactions**: A micro-expression -- a slight frown, a twitch of the lip, a narrowing of the eyes.
- **Intimacy**: Characters physically close together, faces near each other.

### Emotional Effect
Heightened personal connection. The reader begins to feel they are "with" the character rather than observing from a distance. Tension, vulnerability, and sincerity are amplified.

### Recommended Panel Size
**Small to medium**. Can function in relatively compact panels because the framing is tight. In webtoon, medium-width panels at moderate height work well.

### Manga/Manhwa Conventions
- Manga: Extremely common in shoujo and josei for emotional beats. Also used heavily in psychological manga (Death Note, Monster) for tense dialogue exchanges.
- Manhwa/Webtoon: A dominant shot type in romance and drama webtoons (True Beauty, Lore Olympus) where facial expression drives the narrative.

## 6. Close-Up (CU)

### What It Shows
A character's face fills the frame, from forehead to chin approximately. Background is minimal or absent entirely. Every detail of the expression is visible.

### When to Use
- **Emotional climax**: A character crying, screaming, laughing, or making a critical declaration.
- **Reveals**: A character's identity is revealed, or their true emotion finally surfaces.
- **Shock/surprise**: The moment of realization or horror.
- **Determination**: The classic "resolved eyes" panel before a fight or sacrifice.
- **Villain menace**: A villain's smirk, a predator's gaze.

### Emotional Effect
Powerful and direct. The reader cannot avoid the character's emotion. Close-ups create empathy (if the reader sympathizes) or discomfort (if the character is threatening). They are the emotional exclamation points of visual storytelling.

### Recommended Panel Size
**Varies intentionally**. A small close-up panel inserted between larger panels creates a "beat" -- a punctuation mark. A large close-up panel (half-page or more) creates an overwhelming emotional moment. Size choice is itself a storytelling decision.

### Manga/Manhwa Conventions
- Manga: Integral to every genre. The "determined eyes" close-up is a shonen staple (Naruto, My Hero Academia). The "tear falling from eye" close-up is a shoujo staple. In horror manga (Junji Ito, Gantz), close-ups of terrified faces drive the genre.
- Manhwa/Webtoon: Often rendered with high detail and color to maximize impact. Webtoon creators may place a single close-up as a standalone panel between scroll gaps to force the reader to sit with the emotion.

## 7. Extreme Close-Up (ECU)

### What It Shows
A single feature or detail fills the entire frame: an eye, a mouth, a hand gripping something, a drop of sweat, a cracking surface, a key turning in a lock.

### When to Use
- **Detail emphasis**: Draw attention to a specific object or feature that is plot-critical.
- **Tension building**: An eye widening, a finger on a trigger, a heartbeat visualized.
- **Horror/thriller**: An eye peering through a crack, blood dripping onto a surface.
- **Symbolic moments**: A ring on a finger, a scar being revealed, a tear forming.

### Emotional Effect
Intense focus and heightened tension. The extreme close-up removes all context and forces the reader to concentrate on one element. It can create claustrophobia, dread, fascination, or intimacy at the most intense level.

### Recommended Panel Size
**Small to medium, but impactful**. Small ECU panels work as dramatic beats between other panels. A large ECU panel (showing, say, a single eye across a half-page) is a bold dramatic choice that screams importance.

### Manga/Manhwa Conventions
- Manga: Junji Ito uses extreme close-ups of spirals, eyes, and distorted features to create dread. In battle manga, the extreme close-up of an eye is the universal signal that a character has activated a power or reached a new level of resolve (Sharingan in Naruto, Haki in One Piece).
- Manhwa/Webtoon: Frequently used for cliffhangers at the end of an episode -- an extreme close-up of a character's eye or a mysterious object, then the "continue next week" break. The vertical scroll format makes the ECU an excellent pacing tool when placed after empty space.

## 8. Two-Shot

### What It Shows
Two characters framed together in a single panel, typically from the waist or chest up. Both characters are given roughly equal visual prominence.

### When to Use
- **Conversation**: Two characters talking face-to-face or side-by-side.
- **Confrontation**: Two opposing characters squared off, tension visible in the shared frame.
- **Bonding**: Two characters sharing a moment -- watching a sunset, walking together, sitting at a table.
- **Contrast**: Placing two characters together to highlight differences (height, expression, mood, design).
- **Romance**: Two characters in close proximity, the space (or lack thereof) between them telling the story.

### Emotional Effect
Connection and relationship. By placing two characters in the same frame, the artist asserts their relationship as the subject. The distance, angle, and body language between the two characters communicates volumes about their dynamic.

### Recommended Panel Size
**Medium to large**. Needs enough horizontal space to fit two characters comfortably. In webtoon, full-width panels work best for two-shots.

### Manga/Manhwa Conventions
- Manga: Essential for rivalry and friendship dynamics. Goku and Vegeta, Naruto and Sasuke, Luffy and Zoro -- two-shots of paired characters are iconic in shonen. In shoujo, the two-shot of the romantic leads is the genre's bread and butter.
- Manhwa/Webtoon: Used heavily in romance webtoons for "the moment" -- the beat where two characters stand face-to-face and the tension is palpable. Also common in action manhwa for rival standoffs.

## 9. Over-the-Shoulder (OTS)

### What It Shows
The camera is positioned behind one character's shoulder and head (visible in the foreground, often blurred or partially cropped), looking at the second character or at whatever the foreground character is seeing.

### When to Use
- **Dialogue with subjectivity**: The reader sees the conversation from one character's perspective, aligning the audience with that character.
- **Approaching threat**: Show what a character is facing -- a monster, an enemy, an intimidating figure -- with the character's shoulder/head in frame to anchor the reader in their point of view.
- **Power dynamics**: The character in the foreground (seen from behind) can be framed as larger or smaller than the character being faced, communicating dominance or vulnerability.
- **Mystery/reveal**: The foreground character sees something that is being revealed to the reader simultaneously.

### Emotional Effect
Subjective immersion and tension. The OTS shot places the reader "with" one character, looking at the world through their spatial perspective. It creates a sense of being in the scene rather than watching it from outside.

### Recommended Panel Size
**Medium to large**. The foreground shoulder/head element needs space to be readable without crowding the background subject. In webtoon, this works well at full or three-quarter width.

### Manga/Manhwa Conventions
- Manga: Common in confrontation scenes. The OTS shot of a hero facing a villain (villain in background, hero's shoulder/back of head in foreground) is a classic composition. Detective Conan and Death Note use OTS shots extensively in dialogue-heavy deduction scenes.
- Manhwa/Webtoon: Used to create depth in the vertical scroll format, which can sometimes feel flat. The layered foreground/background of the OTS shot adds dimensionality.

## Best Practices for Shot Type Selection

### The 3-of-5 Rule
In any sequence of five consecutive panels, use at least three different shot types. Repeating the same shot type across many panels creates visual monotony and causes the reader's eyes to glaze over. Variety in shot distance keeps the reader's attention active.

**Bad example**: MS, MS, MS, MS, MS (five medium shots in a row during a conversation)
**Good example**: MS, CU, MWS, ECU, MS (same conversation with visual variety)

### Shot Progression for Emotional Escalation
Move from wider shots to tighter shots to build emotional intensity:
1. **Wide/Medium Wide** -- establish the scene, ground the characters
2. **Medium** -- engage with the conversation or action
3. **Medium Close-Up** -- the emotion starts to sharpen
4. **Close-Up** -- the emotional peak
5. **Extreme Close-Up** -- the exclamation point

This progression mirrors the reader's psychological experience of "moving closer" to the emotional core of the scene. Reverse the progression (tight to wide) to create a sense of pulling away, emotional release, or revelation of context.

### Match Shot Type to Information Priority
Ask: **What is the most important thing the reader needs to see in this panel?**
- If the answer is "the environment" -- use EWS or WS.
- If the answer is "the character's full body or action" -- use WS or MWS.
- If the answer is "the character's words and general reaction" -- use MS.
- If the answer is "the character's specific emotion" -- use MCU or CU.
- If the answer is "one specific detail" -- use ECU.

### Vary Shots Across a Dialogue Scene
The most common mistake in manga/manhwa paneling is the "talking heads" problem: an endless sequence of medium shots alternating between two characters. Break this pattern:
- Open with a two-shot or wide shot to establish spatial relationship.
- Use medium shots for the baseline dialogue.
- Cut to close-ups for emotional peaks.
- Insert an extreme close-up for the single most important line or reaction.
- Pull back to a wide or medium wide shot to "reset" the visual energy.
- Use an over-the-shoulder shot to shift reader alignment from one character to another.

### Action Scene Shot Selection
Action demands more variety and faster shot changes than dialogue:
- **Wide shots** for choreography clarity (where is everyone?).
- **Medium wide / cowboy shots** for mid-action movement.
- **Close-ups** for impact moments (fist connecting, blade striking).
- **Extreme close-ups** for reaction beats (eye widening, teeth gritting).
- **Establishing shots** between action phases to reset spatial awareness.

### Webtoon-Specific Considerations
The vertical scroll format changes how shot types function:
- **Wide shots** are most effective at full width, forcing the reader to stop scrolling.
- **Close-ups and ECUs** can be placed between generous scroll gaps (empty space) to create dramatic pauses.
- **Medium shots** work at reduced width (centered, with margins) to create a sense of intimacy or confinement.
- **Alternating panel widths** between shots creates rhythm -- full-width wide shot, narrow medium shot, full-width close-up.

### Panel Size and Shot Type Alignment
As a general guideline:
| Shot Type | Minimum Panel Size | Optimal Panel Size |
|---|---|---|
| Extreme Wide | Large | Full page / full width |
| Wide | Medium-Large | Large |
| Medium Wide | Medium | Medium-Large |
| Medium | Small-Medium | Medium |
| Medium Close-Up | Small | Small-Medium |
| Close-Up | Small (beat) to Large (climax) | Varies by intent |
| Extreme Close-Up | Small (beat) to Medium (emphasis) | Varies by intent |
| Two-Shot | Medium | Medium-Large |
| Over-the-Shoulder | Medium | Medium-Large |

Breaking these guidelines intentionally is a valid artistic choice -- a tiny establishing shot can feel like a memory, and a full-page close-up can feel like an emotional explosion. But breaking them unintentionally creates visual confusion.
