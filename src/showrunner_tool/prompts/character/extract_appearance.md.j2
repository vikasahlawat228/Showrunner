# Task: Extract Character Appearances from Scene Text

Extract detailed visual character descriptions from the following scene text and compare with existing DNA blocks.

## Scene Text

{{ scene_text }}

## Characters to Extract

{% for name in character_names %}
### {{ name }}
{% if name in existing_dna %}
**Existing DNA Block:**

{{ existing_dna[name] }}
```
{% else %}
No existing DNA block.
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Instructions

1. Find every physical description mention for each character in the scene text
2. Extract specific visual details (face, hair, body, clothing, expressions)
3. Compare with existing DNA blocks for consistency
4. Flag any contradictions between scene text and existing DNA
