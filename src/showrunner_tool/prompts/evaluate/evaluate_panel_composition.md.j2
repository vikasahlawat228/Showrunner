# Task: Evaluate Panel Sequence Visual Quality

Analyze the visual variety, flow, and composition of panels.

{% if statistics %}
## Statistical Analysis

- **Total Panels**: {{ statistics.total_panels }}
- **Shot Type Distribution**: {{ statistics.shot_type_distribution }}
- **Angle Distribution**: {{ statistics.angle_distribution }}
- **Size Distribution**: {{ statistics.size_distribution }}
- **Max Consecutive Same Shot**: {{ statistics.consecutive_same_shot }}
- **Max Consecutive Same Angle**: {{ statistics.consecutive_same_angle }}
{% endif %}

{% if panels %}
## Panel Sequence

{% for panel in panels %}
**P{{ panel.page_number }}.{{ panel.panel_number }}** | {{ panel.shot_type }} | {{ panel.camera_angle }} | {{ panel.panel_size }} | {{ panel.mood }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Evaluation Criteria

### Visual Variety
- Are shot types varied? (The "3 of 5" rule: at least 3 different shots per 5 panels)
- Are camera angles varied?
- Is there a mix of panel sizes?

### Visual Flow
- Does the eye move naturally through the sequence?
- Are establishing shots used before close-ups in new locations?
- Do dramatic moments get appropriately sized panels?

### Emotional Mapping
- Do shot types match emotional beats? (close-ups for emotion, wide for action)
- Do camera angles reinforce power dynamics?
- Does pacing through panel size match the scene's rhythm?
